Christina is a character featured in Stranger Things: Hawkins Horrors as the protagonist of Nancy Wheeler 's story \"A Little Voice\". She was a nurse at Pennhurst Asylum in 1969 before leaving her job after learning the truth of a supposed escaped prisoner. Christina Stranger Things: Hawkins Horrors Stranger Things: Hawkins Horrors Nancy Wheeler According to Nancy, her story was a real incident that had been reported in the news. [ 1 ] [ 1 ] [ 1 ] [ ] History [ ] History [ ] [    ] Christina was born around 1946-1947 in Virginia, USA, she eventually got a job at the age of twenty-two at the Pennhurst Asylum in 1969 where she was given the night-shift to work. Prior to becoming a full fledged nurse, she was required to make sure all prisoners were okay and safe before calling lights-out. 1969 [ ] 1969 [ ] [    ] One night during her shift, Christina did her nightly routine check-up on the prisoners to make sure they were safe before returning to her post and waiting two hours to do it again. On her shift, she passed by the room of one prisoner named Ricky Dobbs whom she believed to be saner than the other inmates who was nineteen at the time. Upon not seeing Ricky in his room, she grew worried before hearing him talking to someone causing her to open the door where she saw Ricky on the floor backed up against the wall, she briefly talked with him before Dr. Spears entered the room and demanded Ricky be restrained causing the orderlies to come in. After leaving the room with Christina, the latter questioned Spears on why he made the order before being told that all prisoners were to be restrained by night on the anniversary of Jimmy Ray Cutts' murder spree. The following night, Christina went to work only to be greeted the empty reception room causing her to believe she had forgotten a staff meeting before going to Ricky's cell. Outside the cell, she watched as an orderly rushed out of the room covered in blood. Inside the room, she saw more blood as well as the deceased body of another orderly who had been crushed under the weight of Ricky's bed though Christina believed the former to be innocent under the belief that he would not harm a fly though kept her opinion of the subject to herself. During the interaction, she learned that Ricky had heard a voice but still chose to believe he was innocent and that there was another reason. Later into her shift, Christina was one of many staff members to be called into a meeting by Spears who declared that the Hawkins Police Department were only allowing Ricky to remain in their custody until they did more research into the murder of Michael \"Mick\" Hogan. After the meeting, she went to Ricky's room which had its door covered with police tape with an officer standing guard, Christina asked where Ricky was being kept and made her way to the room before being found by Sophia, an older nurse. Hawkins Police Department Christina then heard about the escape of a man named Harland Buck who had escaped during a day shift prior to Christina's employment. When Christina questioned how she had not heard about it, Sophia told her it was not a story the staff wanted to tell. Eventually, Sophia told her that her ankles were hurting and asked Christina to administer the knock-out drug to Ricky, Christina obliged and made her way out of the room. Upon entering Ricky's room, she questioned him on what was happening though Ricky confessed he would speak to a guy named Buck before he fell asleep due to the drugs in his system. When a storm hit a few nights later, Christina was forced to remain at the asylum due to the weather. Finding Sophia, she requested for another dosage to give to Ricky though Sophia admitted Spears had also been kept behind and therefore wanted to give the inmates their shots himself. Christina's attention was then pulled away when she and Sophia heard screaming and rushed towards the noise where they discovered Ricky in his room trying to strangle Spears to death though, Christina then watched as Spears managed to overpower Ricky and beat him to the ground before kicking him, an incident Christina hated to see as she knew it was violating an the Hippocratic Oath doctors and nurses had made when dealing with patients. When Christina got her next chance to be with Ricky, she made her way into his room to gather more answers though when she has asked him if he was hurting, Ricky told her that he was not before dying in front of her. Christina then began to hear a voice where she thought it was coming from Ricky before discovering it was coming from a hole in the wall after investigating. Once the man revealed himself, Christina realized she was dealing with Harland Buck who she had believed had escaped and was hiding out somewhere. Eventually, she fainted. After that night, Christina quit her job and went back to living in Virginia. One day after reading the newspaper, she discovered that Buck had died within Pennhurst.

However, while searching for Will, they stumbled upon a mysterious girl named Eleven instead. Lucas was suspicious of Eleven's behavior and actions, and believed she was taking advantage of Mike's hospitality; he also doubted the apparent supernatural circumstances behind Will's disappearance. A rift grew between the kids, prompting Lucas to investigate Hawkins National Laboratory on his own; however, this only made Lucas realize that Eleven was trying to protect him and his friends from the threat of government agents, and the dangers that lurked within Hawkins Lab . Lucas reconciled with Eleven, Mike and Dustin, and helped his friends battle the Demogorgon . In the end, Lucas was reunited with Will and celebrated Christmas with his friends. 1983 Hawkins National Laboratory dangers that lurked within Hawkins Lab Demogorgon In 1984 , Lucas and his friends became intrigued by Max Mayfield after her arrival in Hawkins; however, the group became more concerned about Will\u2019s wellbeing after he started behaving unusually. While investigating the Upside Down\u2019s incursion into Hawkins, Lucas and Max eventually developed feelings for each other, despite the threatening behavior of Max\u2019s erratic stepbrother, Billy . Ultimately, Lucas, Max, Steve , Dustin, and Mike assisted in the Mind Flayer 's defeat by burning a core part of the Upside Down's hive mind . One month later, Lucas attended Hawkins Middle's Snow Ball with his friends and began a romantic relationship with Max, as they danced and shared a kiss. 1984 Max Mayfield Billy Steve Mind Flayer a core part of the Upside Down's hive mind Snow Ball By the summer of 1985 , Lucas and Max had gone through various cycles of dating, breaking up and getting back together again; in late June, Max ditched Lucas to hang out with Eleven instead, forcing the group to split up. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] However, the Party's attention soon shifted to Max's stepbrother, Billy, who was noted to be acting unusually. The group later discovered that Billy and various other Hawkins residents were possessed by an incarnation of the Mind Flayer, prompting the Party and their allies to band together to defeat them. Lucas came up with the idea to use fireworks against the creature, which wounded the beast and distracted it long enough to prevent Eleven\u2019s death. Three months later, Lucas said goodbye to Will and Eleven as they moved away from Hawkins, and agreed with Dustin to hand their Dungeons & Dragons set to Lucas's younger sister, Erica . 1985 [ 3 ] [ 3 ] [ ] [ 4 ] [ 4 ] [ ] an incarnation Dungeons & Dragons Erica By the spring of 1986 , Lucas had joined the Hawkins High basketball team, and his busy schedule got in the way of his time at the Hellfire Club , much to Dustin and Mike's frustration. Tired of being bullied, Lucas hoped that joining the basketball team would make him more popular. His relationship with Max had also fallen apart due to her social withdrawal following Billy's death, leaving Lucas worried about her, but she refused to open up to him. [ 4 ] 1986 Hawkins High Hellfire Club [ 4 ] [ 4 ] [ ] After Jason Carver 's girlfriend and various other students were mysteriously killed, Lucas slowly realized he had been hanging with the wrong crowd, unnerved by Jason\u2019s scapegoating of Eddie and the Hellfire Club. Reuniting with his friends, Lucas learned an entity from the Upside Down named Vecna was responsible for the murders, and was using the psychic connection with his victims to open a series of new gates . While trying to stop Vecna, Lucas ended up in a deadly scuffle with Jason, who had tracked him and his friends to the Creel House . Though he ultimately knocked out Jason, he was powerless to stop Vecna\u2019s psychic attack on Max, and the cataclysmic opening of four gigantic gates converging in downtown Hawkins. Max would ultimately survive Vecna's attack due to an intervention by Eleven; though Max remained comatose, Lucas deemed Eleven's actions to be \"a miracle\". In the days that followed, Lucas stayed by Max's side in hospital and read books to her. Later, Lucas and Erica watched in fear as the Upside Down's spores began falling across Hawkins.

Nancy Wheeler Natalia Dyer Stranger Things Stranger Things \"the Party\" Mike Wheeler Steve Harrington Jonathan Byers In the fall of 1983 , Nancy was a straightforward teenager with a straightforward life, unsure whether to prioritize spending time with her best friend Barbara Holland , or with her new boyfriend, Steve Harrington . However, everything changed when Barb vanished without a trace, prompting Nancy to team up with loner Jonathan Byers , whose younger brother, Will , had also vanished. Slowly, the two put together the pieces of the puzzle, and realized a monster from another dimension had kidnapped Barb and Will. While Will was lucky enough to escape the creature's full wrath, Nancy was horrified to learn that Barb had been killed, making her more determined than ever to defeat the creature. Nancy and Jonathan set up a booby-trap at the Byers house , and with the unlikely last-minute assistance of Steve, helped to gravely wound the creature. 1983 Barbara Holland Steve Harrington Jonathan Byers Will a monster another dimension Byers house In the fall of 1984 , Nancy's struggle to grieve Barb created a rift between her and Steve, leading her to drunkenly confess that she didn't love him anymore. Seeking revenge on the people responsible for unleashing the creature that killed Barbara, she once again teamed up with Jonathan and a journalist named Murray Bauman to expose Hawkins Lab . In the process, she and Jonathan grew closer together, eventually succumbing to their feelings and becoming romantically involved. Returning to Hawkins, Nancy and Jonathan learned that another entity from the alternate dimension had possessed Will; Nancy assisted Jonathan and his mother in exorcising the creature from Will's body. A month later, Nancy and Murray's expos\u00e9 succeeded in shutting down Hawkins National Laboratory , with Barb's death attributed to a 'chemical leak'. Nancy attended Barb's funeral and broke up with Steve to be with Jonathan. 1984 Murray Bauman Hawkins Lab another entity mother Hawkins National Laboratory By the summer of 1985 , Nancy and Jonathan became interns for The Hawkins Post , where Nancy was frequently disrespected by her boss Tom Holloway and colleagues, including Bruce Lowe . Working late one night, she answered a call about diseased rats in the town and secretly investigated with Jonathan. This eventually caused the pair to be fired, creating a rift between Nancy and Jonathan. But after receiving some encouragement from her mother, Nancy picked the story back up and discovered that the rats were linked to the same entity that possessed Will. After reconciling, Nancy and Jonathan joined forces with Nancy's younger brother and his friends in once again defeating what the kids called \"the Mind Flayer\". Three months later, the Byers family moved out of Hawkins after being relocated to California by Dr. Sam Owens ; Nancy and Jonathan tearfully parted ways, but remained committed to staying together. 1985 The Hawkins Post The Hawkins Post Tom Holloway Bruce Lowe younger brother the Byers family California Dr. Sam Owens In the spring of 1986 , Nancy became a reporter and editor for the Hawkins High newspaper, The Weekly Streak , and was accepted into Emerson College in Massachusetts. Despite Nancy and Jonathan's enduring love, neither could get away to meet for spring break, and Nancy grew annoyed over Jonathan's lack of communication. [ 2 ] When multiple Hawkins High students were found murdered, Nancy investigated their deaths with Steve, Dustin , Max , and Robin , and drew a link to the Creel murders from the 1950s. The group believed an entity from the Upside Down - dubbed \"Vecna\" - was using the killings for some grander purpose. Following Nancy, Steve, Robin and Eddie Munson 's brief misadventure in the Upside Down, Vecna psychically revealed his identity to Nancy, and shared his plans for the future. The group tried and failed to stop Vecna, with four enormous gates opening and wreaking havoc across Hawkins. Two days later, Nancy reunited with Jonathan upon his return to Hawkins, where the two worked on fixing up Hopper's cabin . Moments later, Nancy and Jonathan, along with their friends, watched in horror as the Upside Down began to merge with Hawkins. 1986 Hawkins High The Weekly Streak The Weekly Streak [ 2 ] [ 2 ] [ ] multiple Hawkins High students Dustin Max Robin Creel murders \"Vecna\" Eddie Munson his plans four enormous gates Hopper's cabin"}

He oversaw a failed mission to destroy part of the Hawkins tunnels , which led to a pack of adolescent Demogorgons invading and attacking the lab; Owens was the only known surviving staff member. Mothergate Upside Down Mind Flayer Will Byers Hawkins tunnels a pack of adolescent Demogorgons After Dr. Brenner's escaped child test subject, Eleven , used her psychokinetic abilities to seal the Mothergate, the ordeal at Hawkins Lab finally came to an end. One month later, the lab had been shut down, partly due to an expos\u00e9 published by Murray Bauman , Nancy Wheeler , and Jonathan Byers . Around the same time, Owens helped Jim Hopper officially adopt Eleven, handing him a forged birth certificate. Following the lab's closure, Owens became an official within the U.S. Military, attaining an unspecified position and rank. Eleven Murray Bauman Nancy Wheeler Jonathan Byers Jim Hopper In July 1985, Owens received a distress call from Hopper; he was informed that the Soviet Union had infiltrated Hawkins, having built a secret underground base beneath the town's brand-new shopping mall . Owens and a military squadron then travelled to Hawkins and launched an assault on the secret base, though found the facility had been swiftly abandoned. While there, Owens surveyed the wreckage of the Soviets's experimental machine , and a corresponding remnant of a gate to the Upside Down. Owens proceeded to cover up the Russian invasion, the Upside Down\u2019s presence and various deaths by allowing a fire in the mall's food court to spread, which ultimately destroyed the mall in its entirety. In the months that followed, Owens was fired due to his failure to detect the invasion; Owens also helped the Byers family and Eleven relocate to Lenora Hills , California . Soviet Union a secret underground base shopping mall the Soviets's experimental machine Lenora Hills California Upon learning that Eleven had lost access to her abilities, Owens began working with Dr. Brenner on a experimental scheme that could restore them; the two scientists repurposed an ICBM silo in Nevada and made it the \"Nina Project\" facility, housing a customised sensory deprivation tank called \"NINA\". In March 1986, Owens informed Eleven he had found a means to restore her powers, and that a \"war\" with the Upside Down was fast approaching. Eleven agreed to participate, but was shocked to re-encounter Brenner. After \"re-experiencing\" several repressed memories inside the NINA tank and regaining her powers, Eleven insisted on travelling to Hawkins, seeking to stop Henry Creel and the Upside Down's incursion, despite Brenner's wishes. A sympathetic Dr. Owens arranged transportation for Hawkins; however, Brenner sabotaged their plans and incapacitated both Owens and Eleven. The situation at the facility soon devolved further when the erratic Lt. Col. Sullivan launched a full-scale military attack, intent on killing Eleven. However, Eleven quickly overpowered Sullivan's forces and escaped with the aid of Mike Wheeler , Will, Jonathan, and Argyle ; Dr. Brenner perished in the attack, though Owens seemingly survived. \"Nina Project\" sensory deprivation tank Henry Creel Lt.

The entity appeared to entirely consist of silver-black particles linked together through a group intelligence. Shadow Monster particles Mind Flayer shadowy entity silver-black particles The entity was gigantic, looming at least fifty stories tall [ 1 ] and sporting a distinctive spider-like appearance. The Mind Flayer exercised supreme control over the Upside Down via a psychic link, with Demogorgons , vines , and Demobats forming a shared hive mind ; for a period in 1985 , possessed humans known as \"the Flayed\" also comprised part of the hive mind. This meant the entirety of the Upside Down was essentially like one gigantic organism, with all its contents and agents mentally connected via the Mind Flayer. [ 1 ] [ 1 ] [ ] Upside Down Demogorgons vines Demobats hive mind 1985 \"the Flayed\" The entity\u2019s first known encounter with humanity occurred in the 1950s , when a young child named Henry Creel was accidentally transported to Dimension X and exposed to the entity\u2019s influence; upon returning home, Henry found he had gained special psychokinetic abilities, but was also vulnerable to the entity\u2019s influence, making him use his powers to commit violent acts. Years later, in 1979 , Creel once again found himself in Dimension X and encountered the shadowy entity once more, though he appeared to have no memory of the earlier event. This time, Henry used his powers to reconstitute the mist into a form that satisfied him: a giant, spider-like entity with a flame-shaped head. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] the 1950s Henry Creel Dimension X 1979 [ 2 ] [ 2 ] [ ] [ 3 ] [ 3 ] [ ] In 1983 , a gate to the Upside Down - a dimension somehow related to Dimension X - was accidentally opened by Eleven at Hawkins Lab . Henry, also known as Vecna, first actively attempted to take over the world in 1984 . Acting through the Mind Flayer - which had since awakened or materialised within the Upside Down - Vecna possessed Will Byers and an army of adolescent Demogorgons, or \"Demodogs\". Eleven interfered by closing the gate at Hawkins Lab, severing the psychic link between the worlds and killing the Demodogs in the process. As Eleven closed the Gate, Will's friends and family forced a piece of the Mind Flayer out of his body, which was later rendered dormant after the Gate's closure. 1983 Upside Down Eleven Hawkins Lab 1984 Will Byers The isolated piece of the Mind Flayer remained dormant at Brimborn Steel Works until 1985 , when a newly opened gate reestablished the psychic link to Vecna. Via this piece, Vecna began kidnapping and possessing multiple humans and rats, feeding them chemicals and melting their bodies into puddles of biomass. This biomass was then combined to create a proxy form , through which Vecna could directly act in the human world; like the Mind Flayer, this proxy form also resembled a spider, and had the same flame-shaped head. However, this proxy form was rendered useless and inert after the new Gate was shut, and the psychic link disabled once again. [ 4 ] Brimborn Steel Works 1985 gate a proxy form [ 4 ] [ 4 ] [ ] In the same time period, the Soviet Union somehow captured a portion of the Mind Flayer's particles and stored them at a military base in Kamchatka , along with an adult Demogorgon and a number of paralysed Demodogs. Hopper , Joyce and Murray escaped the base in March 1986 , but returned to destroy the Mind Flayer's particles, hoping to aid their allies in Hawkins by inflicting damage to the Upside Down's hive mind. However, upon their return, they discovered that the particles had escaped confinement and possessed the bodies of the paralysed Demogorgons, freeing them. They were forced to change their plans, aiming to kill the Demogorgons instead, as doing so would also destroy fragments of the Mind Flayer, and weaken Vecna in the process.

A newcomer to the Party , and the stepsister of Billy Hargrove , she is best friends with Will Byers , Dustin Henderson , Jane \"Eleven\" Hopper , Lucas Sinclair , and Mike Wheeler ; she also has an on-and-off romantic relationship with Lucas.

Following her mother's divorce and remarriage to Neil Hargrove in 1984, Max and her erratic stepbrother Billy moved to Hawkins , Indiana . Max quickly gained a reputation at the Palace Arcade for topping the game leader boards, her high scores submitted under the player name \"MADMAX\". Max's high scores captured the attention of arcade regulars Dustin, Lucas, Will, and Mike, who mistakenly assumed her to be a boy. After Maxine joined the boys' class at Hawkins Middle School , they realised the new girl and the mysterious MADMAX were one and the same. On Halloween, Max crossed paths with the boys while trick-or-treating, and despite being weirded-out by their earlier behaviour, had a change of heart, and sought to befriend them. Dustin and Lucas, each secretly pining for her affection, wanted to make Max an official member of the Party , but Mike pushed back against the idea. California mother's Neil Hargrove Hawkins Indiana Palace Arcade Hawkins Middle School the Party When Will started experiencing strange 'episodes', Max took notice, and became even more curious after learning of Will's disappearance the previous year. Though her new friends were initially reluctant to explain what had happened to Will, Lucas eventually divulged the whole history of events involving Will, Eleven , the Demogorgon and the Upside Down . Though skeptical at first, Max's convictions would shift after encountering a pack of faceless humanoid predators alongside Lucas, Dustin and their friend Steve Harrington . Max and her friends soon realized Will was possessed by the \" Mind Flayer \", a malevolent entity serving as the mind and heart of the Upside Down, whose influence in Hawkins was expanding in the form of gigantic, vine-like tunnels burrowing deep beneath the city. Eleven the Demogorgon Upside Down a pack of faceless humanoid predators Steve Harrington Mind Flayer gigantic, vine-like tunnels Max grew romantically attached to Lucas, but had an awkward first meeting with Eleven upon her return to Hawkins. After standing up to an erratic and violent Billy after his assault on Steve at the Byers house , Max further proved her worth, stealing Billy's car and transporting the group to the underground tunnels. There, they assisted in the fight against the Mind Flayer by attacking the Upside Down's shared hive mind. After defeating the Mind Flayer, Max attended the Snow Ball with her new group of friends, and after sharing her first kiss with Lucas, would begin a relationship with him. Eleven Byers house Snow Ball By the summer of 1985, Max had befriended Eleven, while going through cycles of dating Lucas, breaking up with him and getting back together again. However, to Max's discomfort, the Party's attention shifted to Billy after he was noted to be acting unusually. The group would later discover that Billy had become possessed by the Mind Flayer, prompting the Party and their allies to band together to defeat them. While the group battled the Spider Monster with fireworks at Starcourt Mall , Eleven reminded Billy of his humanity; her words prompted Billy to sacrifice his life to save Eleven's, which horrified and traumatized Max. Despite her rocky relationship with Billy, Max was deeply affected by her stepbrother's loss and experienced a profound sense of grief, survivor's guilt, and depression. Three months later, Max, along with the rest of the Party, tearfully said goodbye to the Byers and Eleven, who had been relocated to California by Dr. Owens . Spider Monster Starcourt Mall Dr. Owens Months later, Max still struggled with Billy's loss, suffering from frequent nightmares in which she would relive the moment of his death. She isolated herself from her friends, breaking up for good with Lucas. However, in March 1986, she decided to help her old friends investigate the murder of Chrissy Cunningham . After learning she was experiencing the same disturbing hallucinations and symptoms that Chrissy had, Max and her friends came to the conclusion that she had been \"cursed\" by a mysterious Upside Down entity dubbed \"Vecna\" , and that she didn't have much time to live. However, when the time came, Max was able to survive Vecna\u2019s attacks when her friends played her favorite song over her headphones, giving her the emotional strength to defy Vecna and return to reality. Chrissy Cunningham disturbing hallucinations \"cursed\" Upside Down \"Vecna\" her favorite song After discovering Vecna's plan to use the murders to open four gates , the group came up with a plan of attack; Max would act as bait to distract Vecna, while Nancy, Steve and Robin would attack his real body in the Upside Down. At the abandoned Creel House , Max made herself hallucinate again, but to her surprise, Eleven appeared in her visions, via her power of psychic projection . However, Vecna overpowered Eleven, and began killing Max. Due to the actions of Eleven, Nancy, Steve, and Robin, Max initially survived the attack, though she was blinded and her limbs were broken; for a moment, her heart even stopped. This technical death triggered the opening of the fourth and final curse gate , wreaking havoc across Hawkins. However, Eleven used her abilities to restart Max's heart. She was brought back to life, but remained comatose, teetering on the boundary between life and death. four gates Robin Creel House psychic projection fourth and final curse gate"}

During their investigations, Hopper and Joyce met Eleven , the escaped child test subject who unwittingly opened the gate using special psychokinetic abilities. Eventually, Hopper and Joyce were permitted to travel through the gate and search for Will in the alternate dimension, where they successfully located, revived and rescued him. Hawkins Indiana Joyce Byers Will Hawkins National Laboratory gate an alternate dimension Eleven Later that year, Hopper discovered that Eleven, presumed to be deceased, was actually alive, fending for herself in the woods. He decided to take her in, providing a home for her in his cabin , and did everything in his power to hide her from the authorities. After local crops began to rot in October 1984, Hopper discovered that mysterious tunnels beneath Hawkins were the source of the decay. Dr. Owens , the new head of Hawkins Lab, reluctantly informed him that the interdimensional gate beneath the facility was actively growing in size, and in turn corrupting the surrounding environment. Later, Hopper and Owens were took off-guard when a pack of adolescent Demogorgons called \"Demodogs\" hailing from the alternate dimension attacked the laboratory, with Hopper and his allies only narrowly surviving. The immediate threat was neutralized when Eleven, accompanied by Hopper, returned to the laboratory; Eleven sealed the Gate with her special abilities, cutting off the connection to what she called \" the Upside Down \". In the months that followed, Hawkins Lab was shut down, with Hopper watching as cement filled in the last traces of the Gate. With Owens's help, Hopper was able to officially adopt Eleven, her legal name becoming \"Jane Hopper\". cabin local crops mysterious tunnels Dr. Owens \"Demodogs\" the Upside Down In June 1985, Hopper and Joyce began investigating a vast conspiracy involving the corrupt mayor , suspicious activity at the local power grid , and the newly-built Starcourt Mall . After taking the Russian scientist Dr. Alexei hostage and meeting the Russian-speaking journalist Murray Bauman , Hopper learned that a secret Soviet base had been built under Starcourt Mall; the base housed an experimental technology which could pry open the already-weakened fabric of reality in Hawkins, Indiana. Hopper, Joyce and Murray later infiltrated the secret base and set out to disable the Soviet machine. Though they achieved this goal, it came at a heavy cost; Hopper was captured by the Soviets and was presumed deceased by Joyce and the rest of Hawkins. The Soviets tortured him for information and forced him into servitude at their prison camp in Kamchatka . the corrupt mayor the local power grid Starcourt Mall Russian Dr. Alexei Murray Bauman a secret Soviet base an experimental technology prison camp Kamchatka By March 1986, Hopper had struck up a complicated friendship with security guard Dmitri Antonov , who decided to help him escape. Antonov sent a package containing a hidden message to Joyce, which prompted her and Murray to travel to Russia in an effort to free him. Hopper and Antonov, punished for Hopper's attempt to escape, were later forced to fight one of the Soviet-captured Demogorgons ; Hopper and Dmitri were able to evade the creature's wrath and escape the facility with the help of Joyce and Murray. However, the group later returned to the prison after learning of a new evil from the Upside Down imperilling Hawkins; they hoped to kill the captured Demogorgons and by extension, deal damage to the Upside Down's hive mind . After some time, Hopper, Joyce and Murray managed to achieve this, with Antonov and Yuri Ismaylov arriving by helicopter to take them back to America . Upon his return to Hawkins, Hopper and Eleven happily reunited before watching in horror as four newly-opened gates spewed plumes of smoke and the Upside Down's spores across Hawkins.

He arrived in Hawkins in fourth grade, growing a strong bond with Mike, Lucas and Will and becoming best friends. Hawkins When Will mysteriously went missing, Dustin, Lucas and Mike made it their mission to find him. However, while searching for Will, they stumbled upon a mysterious girl named Eleven instead. After learning Eleven possessed special psychokinetic abilities, Mike believed she could aid the quest to find Will, though Lucas was suspicious of Eleven's behavior and actions; Dustin acted as a meditator between the two, keeping them focused on the task at hand. Dustin and his friends deduced that Will was lost in an alternate dimension , one that could be accessed via a \"gate\" at Hawkins Lab ; though the group were unable to personally retrieve Will, Dustin and his friends later faced off against the creature that had abducted him, with Eleven seemingly sacrificing her life to defeat the Demogorgon. The group later joyfully reunited with Will, who had been rescued and brought to hospital.

On Halloween night, Dustin discovered a slug-like creature in his trash that he named Dart , and hid him in his home. This proved to be a mistake when Dart grew into a juvenile Demogorgon; however, due to Dustin\u2019s influence, Dart proved to be somewhat more docile  than the rest of his kind. Ultimately, Dustin, Lucas, Max, Steve , and Mike assisted in the Mind Flayer 's defeat by burning a core part of the Upside Down's hive mind ; the pack of juvenile Demogorgons, including Dart, died soon after when Eleven closed the gate.

Upon returning to Hawkins , Dustin was annoyed by his friends' disinterest in his new radio Cerebro , as well as their scepticism of Suzie's existence. While trying to communicate with Suzie with Cerebro, Dustin accidentally intercepted a Russian-language transmission. [ 3 ] Afterward, he requested Steve, along with Steve's co-worker Robin Buckley and Lucas's younger sister Erica to help him with the message. The message lead them to discover the Russians were in Hawkins working on opening another Gate underneath Starcourt Mall . After escaping the Russian base, Dustin reunited and reconciled with his friends and helped them defeat the Mind Flayer once again. Dustin obtained Planck's Constant from Suzie, which Joyce Byers and Jim Hopper needed so they could destroy the Russian machine and close the gate.

One night, he was visited by Christina who entered his room upon not being able to find him though he was restrained by orderlies when Dr. Sears entered the room. Over the course of Christina's shifts, Ricky was administered sleeping drugs to ease him.

However, Will's life would turn upside-down on November 6 , 1983 ; while cycling home from his friends' latest D&D campaign, Will crossed paths with a humanoid predator hailing from an alternate dimension . Will tried his best to escape, but the creature cornered him, transporting him to its home dimension. For a week, Will evaded the creature while his family and friends desperately searched for him; he found a way to communicate with his mother Joyce across dimensions by manipulating electricity. Will was eventually captured by the creature and taken to the other dimension's version of the public library , where he was strung up and attached to a mysterious alien vine . Joyce and the local chief of police, Jim Hopper , travelled into the alternate dimension via an interdimensional gateway at Hawkins National Laboratory , and finally managed to locate Will. He was taken to hospital to recover, where he reunited with his family and friends. Although Will returned to his old life in Hawkins, his time in what his friends called \"The Upside Down\" had left a mark on his psyche; he began to experience visions of the two worlds flickering in and out of existence.

However, his visions proved to be of a much stranger and more sinister nature. Will began to see a gigantic spider-like creature looming in the skies of the Upside Down, and despite his best efforts to resist, became possessed by the entity. The creature, which Will's friends dubbed the \"Mind Flayer\", exploited its connection to Will to manipulate Owens and the scientists at Hawkins Lab, resulting in many deaths and casualties at the facility. With the help of Joyce, Jonathan, and Mike's sister, Nancy , the portion of the creature that inhabited Will was driven out of his body, disappearing into the night. Additionally, Eleven , an escaped child test subject from Hawkins Lab with psychokinetic abilities, and a friend to Mike, Lucas and Dustin, used her powers to seal the interdimensional gateway; this cut off the Mind Flayer\u2019s psychic link, and for a time, ended the Upside Down\u2019s incursion into Hawkins.

He attempted to organize new Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, but grew upset and angry when he saw his friends were clearly losing interest. To make matters worse, Will sensed that the Mind Flayer's presence still lingered in Hawkins, and discovered that Max's stepbrother Billy was being used at its new puppet. Putting his feelings behind him, he joined his friends in once again fighting the Mind Flayer.

Shortly after, Brenner discovered that Henry possessed dangerous psychokinetic abilities, and had killed his mother and sister . After convincing the government to let him take Henry into his custody, Brenner disabled the boy\u2019s abilities via an implanted chip , while also reproducing his abilities in several child test subjects at Hawkins Lab, including Eleven . On September 8 , 1979 , Henry, who Brenner forced to work as a lab orderly, convinced Eleven to remove his suppressant chip.

In the following week, Brenner and his team searched for Eleven while investigating the newly opened gateway to the other dimension (informally known as the Upside Down).

Eleven participated and ultimately regained her abilities, but Brenner insisted on pushing her abilities beyond their previous limit. When Eleven and Dr. Owens opted to return to Hawkins instead, Brenner retaliated by seizing control of the facility, and incapacitated both Eleven and Owens. The US Military arrived and attacked the facility, believing Eleven to be the cause of the issues plaguing Hawkins.

While the teenagers stayed over at Murray's, Murray poked fun at the pair, advising them to stop avoiding their feelings for each other. Murray later helped them release tapes containing an unwitting \"confession\" by Hawkins Lab director Dr. Sam Owens .
