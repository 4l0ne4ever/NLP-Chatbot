Mike, "Something is coming. Something hungry for blood. A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness. It is almost here. What if it's the Demogorgon? Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon. It's not the Demogorgon. An army of troglodytes charge into the chamber! Wait a minute. Did you hear that? That... that sound? Boom... boom... [yells] Boom! That didn't come from the troglodytes. No, that... That came from something else. The Demogorgon! Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign! Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes! But that'll ruin the flow! I'm serious, Mom. The campaign took two weeks to plan. How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours? You've been playing for ten hours? Four years ago! It was a seven. Huh? You're disgusting! What the hell, Mike? I think it's kinda cool. It's like you have superpowers or something. Like Mr. Fantastic. We should be out there right now. We should be helping look for him. I don't care what the chief said. We have to do something. Will can be in danger. Mom! This is such bullshit. Wait, this is Will's fault? Her new boyfriend. I'm the only one acting normal here! I'm the only one that cares about Will! Mike! Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike. Lucas? I know it's you. And say "over" when you're done talking so I know when you're done. Over. I'm worried about Will. Over. I was thinking... Will could've cast Protection last night, but he didn't. He cast Fireball. Over. My point is... he could've played it safe, but he didn't. He put himself in danger to help the party. Over. Will! [in Australian accent] Hello, this is Mike Wheeler, president of Hawkins Middle AV Club. [laughs] Shut up, guys! Stop it! Yes, sir."
Lucas, "Told ya. [chuckling] Where'd it go? Where is it? Where is it? Can you find it yet? Oh, my God! Freaking idiot! Why do we have to go? Yeah. She's got a stick up her butt. Later. Good night, ladies. I didn't say "go"! Get back here! I'm gonna kill you! I'm telling you, his mom's right. Yeah. Byers! Seriously, Dustin? You wanna be a baby, then go home already! No, you're just being a big sissy! What are you doing? Ah, man. This is it. Yeah."
Dustin, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yo, hey, guys. Does anyone want this? Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk. Nuh-uh, she used to be cool. Just saying. Kiss your mom 'night for me. Hey! Hey! I've got your X-Men 134! Guys, I really think we should turn back. I'm just being realistic, Lucas! Did you ever think Will went missing because he ran into something bad? And we're going to the exact same spot where he was last seen? And we have no weapons or anything? I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you? Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it. [in Australian accent] Hello, this is Dustin, and this is the secretary and treasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club. Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast? [chuckles] Yes, sir."
Will, "I don't know! I'd have to roll a 13 or higher! I don't know! No, I can't find it! Oh, I got it! Does the seven count? It was a seven? The roll, it was a seven. The Demogorgon, it got me. See you tomorrow. I'll take your X-Men 134! Mom? Jonathan? Mom? Hello? Hello? Password? Yeah. You may enter. I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it. No, I won't. I don't get scared like that anymore. No. No. Mom... I'm not five anymore. Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!"
Karen, "Mike! Mike! Mike! You mean the end? Fifteen after. Oh, Joyce, hi. No, no, no, it's just Mike. Will? No, he left here a little bit after 8:00. Why? He's not home? Okay. Bye. We've been over this, Mike. The chief says-- Michael! More reason to stay put. End of discussion. No, not cool. Why do you think? Am I speaking Chinese in this house? Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves. Language. Nancy, take that back. Steve? Language! Nancy, come back. Come back! It's okay. It's okay, Holly. Here, have some juice, okay? You see, Michael? That is really unfair, son. Let him go."
Ted, "Hey! Quiet! Language. Are you kidding? Who is Steve? What did I do? Hey! What'd I do?"
Nancy, "Yeah. No, I don't think... Yeah, he's cute. Barb, no, I don't think so. Hey, Nancy. There's a slice left if you want it. Sausage and pepperoni! Hold on. Keep your voice down. I told you, it's not like that. Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me, but not like that. We just... made out a couple times. No, I'm not. You better still hang out with me, that's all I'm saying. Oh, that's gross! Okay, I'm telling you, it was a one-time... Two-time thing. Steve... I have to go. Steve. I really, like... Seriously, I have to go. Wait, wait, wait. Let's... Uh... No, I can't. I have to study for Kaminsky's test. Kaminsky's tests are impossible. You failed chem. Are you crazy? My mom would not-- You are crazy. Wait, wait, wait. Just... Okay, forget about that. Steve... I have to study. I'm not kidding. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00. To study. So... me and Barbara are gonna study at her house tonight. What? Why not? So we're under house arrest? No! You're just pissed off 'cause you wanna hang out with Steve. You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler."
Barbara, "So, did he call? Did he? Nance, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. If you become friends with Tommy H. or Carol-- You were saying?"
Steve, "Mmm-hmm? In a minute. Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah? Oh, come on. What's your GPA again? 3.999... Well, then, just let me help. C-minus. So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00? I'll climb through your window. She won't even know I'm there. I'm stealthy, like a ninja. We can just... We can just, like, chill in my car. We can find a nice quiet place to park, and... Well, why do you think I want it to be nice and quiet? What'd I tell you? Ninja. "Which polymers occur naturally?" Mmm. "In a molecule of CH4, the hydrogen atoms are spatially oriented towards the centers of--" Wow. Jesus, how many of these did you make? You said you wanted to help. How about this? How about... How about every time that you get something right, I have to take off an item of clothing. But every time that you get something wrong-- Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. It'll be fun. "During fractional distillation, hydrocarbons are separated according to their--" Ooh, it's boiling points. Yeah, that's not what you said. No? Oh, do you need... Do you need help, or... Steve, come on. What? Are you crazy? My parents are here. That's weird, I... don't see them. No. Nancy, no. You mean, you're not a slut. You know, you're so cute when you lie. Bad Steve. [groans] Bad. Don't do that to Miss Nancy... "Compared to the rate of inorganic reactions, the rate of organic reactions is generally...""
Joyce, "Where the hell are they? Jonathan? Oh... Got them. Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight. Yeah, see you later. Where's Will? Oh, I didn't get him up yet. Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up! I told you a thousand times. Will! Come on, honey. It's time to get up. He came home last night, right? He's not in his room? Did he come home or not? You don't know? You were working? Jonathan, we've talked about this. I can't believe you. Hi, Karen. It's Joyce. Was that Will I heard back there? Will didn't spend the night? Um, you know what? I think he just left early for... for school. Thank you so much. Bye. I have been waiting here over an hour, Hopper. I'm going out of my mind! No, not my Will. He's not like that. He wouldn't do that. Look, he's not like you, Hopper. He's not like me. He's not like... most. He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean. They make fun of him. They call him names. They laugh at him, his clothes-- What's wrong with his clothes? I don't know. Does that matter? Look, he's... He's a sensitive kid. Lonnie... [sighs] [softly] Called him a fag. He's missing is what he is. Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis. That was about a year ago. But he has nothing to do with this. You know, Hopper, he has nothing to do with this. Trust me. [stammers] What about the other time? You said, "99 out of 100." What about the other time, the one? The one! Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay? Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie. He will talk to me before he talks to-- A cop! [voice breaking] Just find my son, Hop. Find him! Thank you, sir. So, guess what? I got off early and... Ta-da! Poltergeist. I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it. I changed my mind. As long as you don't have nightmares for a week. Oh, yeah? Not even of clowns? What about my witch? Ooh... But Will Byers... I'm going to cook you up in my-- Will? Will? Will! Will? Will! Where are you? Is Lonnie there? Can you please-- Who is this? Cynthia, this is Joyce. Lonnie's ex-wife. I really need to speak to him-- No, not later. Now! Bitch! What? Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me. Will is... is missing. I don't know where he is. [voice breaking] I need... I just need you to call me back, please, just-- Damn it! Damn it! What? It was just lying there? Did it have any blood on it, or-- You're not sure? [Jonathan] Jonathan, wow. You took these? These are great. [sniffling] Wow, they really are. I know I haven't been there for you. [stammers] I've been... working so hard and I... I just feel bad. I don't even... barely know what's going on with you. [chuckles] All right? I am sorry about that. What is it? What is it, honey? Tell me. Tell me. Come on. You can... No. [sobbing] It was him. Yes. [sobbing] He just breathed. He just breathed. I... It was him. I know it was his breathing. I know it was his breathing. Hello? Hello? Lonnie? Dad? Hopper? Who is this? Will? Will? [yelling] Who is this? [yelling] What have you done to my boy? Give me back my son! Hello? Hello, who is this? Hello? Who is this?"
Jonathan, "Check the couch! Ugh, I did. Yeah, see you later. He's probably still sleeping. Mom, I'm making breakfast. He's not in his room? No. [stammering] I got home late. I was working. You were working? Eric asked if I could cover. I said yeah. I just thought we could use the extra cash. I know, I know. You can't take shifts when I'm working. Mom, it's not a big deal. Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day. I'm sure he just stayed over. I can't believe you sometimes. Will? [shouting] Will? Will? Will! Where are you? Mom. What? You have to stay calm. Mom? Cops. Yeah. So... maybe he came home. Nothing, he's probably just hungry. Come on. Nothing. [sniffles] No. [voice breaking] I should've been there for him. Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom? Look at me, Mom. Was it Will? What did he say? And was someone else there? Mom, who was there? Who was it?"
Hopper, "Oh, hey, morning, Flo. Morning, everybody. Damn! You look like hell, Chief. Well, I looked better than your wife when I left her this morning. While you were drinking or sleeping, On a more pressing matter, Okay, I'm gonna get on that. Just give me a minute. Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this. Mornings are for coffee and contemplation. Chief, she's already in your-- Coffee and contemplation, Flo! [sighs deeply] And I apologize again. Look, boy his age, he's probably just playing hookie, okay? Well, you never know. I mean, my mom thought I was on the debate team, when really I was just screwing Chrissy Carpenter in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so... Look, he's not like you, Hopper. He's not like me. When was the last time you heard from Lonnie? Why don't you give me his number? Joyce, 99 out of 100 times, kid goes missing, the kid is with a parent or relative. What? Joyce. Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay? You wanna know the worst thing that's ever happened here in the four years I've been working here? Do you wanna know the worst thing? It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head because it thought that her hair was a nest. What, a pig? I always had a distaste for science. Yeah, Ms. Ratliff was a piece of work. Oh, I believe it. Mummies never die, so they tell me. Sarah, my daughter... Galaxies, the universe, whatnot... She always understood all that stuff. I always figured there was enough going on down here, I never needed to look elsewhere. Your daughter, what grade is she? No, she, uh... She lives with her mom in the city. Thanks for coming out, Teach. We really appreciate it. Listen, I want you to call Flo. I want to get a search party together, all right? All the volunteers she can muster. Bring flashlights, too. Mirkwood? Have you ever heard of Mirkwood? Yeah, all right, I think I know that-- I said that I know it! No. No. After school, you are all to go home. Immediately. That means no biking around looking for your friend, no investigating, no nonsense. This isn't some Lord of the Rings book. [softly] Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself... clear?"
Flo, "While you were drinking or sleeping, or whatever it is you deemed so necessary on Monday morning, Phil Larson called. Said some kids are stealing the gnomes out of his garden again. Joyce is very upset. Joyce Byers can't find her son this morning."
Phil, "Said some kids are stealing the gnomes out of his garden again. If you found the bike out there, why are you here?"
Callahan, "Will Byers? Will Byers? Come on, kid! That his bike? You think he got hurt in the fall? Hey! What are you, deaf? I've been calling you. Hey, you think we got a problem here?"
Powell, "Will! Will? [whistles]"
Mr. Clarke, "Remember, finish chapter 12 and answer 12.3 on the difference between an experiment and other forms of science investigation. This will be on the test, which will cover chapters 10 through 12. It will be multiple choice with an essay section. Sorry, boys. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... it came. The Heathkit ham shack. Ain't she a beaut? He's a good student. What? Will. He's a good student. Great one, actually. I don't think we've met. Scott Clarke. Teacher, Hawkins Middle. Earth and biology. Well, maybe you had a bad teacher. Ratliff? You bet. She's still kicking around, believe it or not. Your daughter, what grade is she? Maybe I'll get her in my class."
Benny, "All right, and one more. Hey, Ben. What do you think about that, uh... I don't know. I don't know. Thirty-seven now, but... Mr. Basket. Geez. Your parents forget to feed you? Is that why you ran away? They, uh... They hurt you? You went to the hospital, you got scared, you ran off, you wound up here, is that it? All right. I'll give this back, all right? And you can have as much as you want. All right? Maybe even some ice cream. But you gotta answer a few of my questions first, all right? We got a deal? All right, let's start with the easy stuff. All right? My name's Benny. Benny Hammond. See? Like this. Here. I got you. Don't worry. It's okay. Nice to meet you, yeah. And you are? Well, I'll be damned. She speaks. "No"? No, what? [clicks tongue] All right. I guess no more food, then. Yeah. What's it mean? All right, then. [chuckles] Here you go. Take it easy, take it easy. Yeah, look, all I know is that she's scared to death. Yeah, I think maybe she's been abused or... kidnapped or something. Yeah, it'd be great if someone would come by. Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane. Yeah, Randolph. You like that ice cream, huh? Smile looks good on you. You know, smile? All right. You just sit tight. Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away real quick, all right? Hey, can I help you? I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid we're closed for the evening, too. So try back tomorrow morning. Ah, Social Services. My apologies. I didn't expect you so soon. That's a heck of a drive. Hey, listen, I... I haven't told her that you're coming yet. I didn't want her running off again. She's a tad skittish. Right, right. So, where is she? Right. She's in the kitchen. Come on up. I'll introduce you. Sorry again for trying to turn you away there. You know, it's funny. Your, uh, voice sounds different on the--"
Connie Frazier, "Hi, you must be Benny Hammond. Connie Frazier. Social Services. Not too bad this time of night. Children I work with usually are. Thank you. It's fine.
Eleven, "No. Eleven. Eleven."
Troy, "Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up and get your tickets for the freak show. Who do you think would make more money in a freak show? Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless? God, it gets me every time."
Liz, "All right, thank you, Donna. Turning now to local news,
