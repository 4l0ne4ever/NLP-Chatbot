00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,125
Exactly.

496
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:40,011
Turns out, this secret room
needs air just like any old room.

497
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,720
And these air ducts

Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know

You're playing with my legs.

I'm not playing,

I don't know. He looks
pretty normal to me.

529
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,433
Normal? How many times have
you seen him with a shirt on?

530
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,683
I mean, it's a little weird.

531
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,761
More than a little.

532
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,715
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.

533
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,137
- Plus everything else...
- But he's lounging at the pool,

534
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,437
which is, like, the least
Mind Flayer thing ever.

00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,021
Not necessarily.

536
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,565
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.

537
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,318
He only used me when he needed me.

538
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,487
It's like... like you're dormant.

539
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,493
And then, when he needs you,

540
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,785
you're activated.

541
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,958
Okay, so we just...

542
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,498
wait until he gets activated.

543
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,995
No. What if he hurts someone?

544
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,083
Or kills someone.

545
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,627
We can't take that chance.

546
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,710
We need to find out if he's the host.

- Where are you going?
- I have an idea. Boys only.

- Seriously?
- Just trust me on this one.

549
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,273
Okay, so we wait until the pool
closes, until everyone leaves,

550
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,363
and we somehow get him
to come from here and...

551
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,943
get him into here.

And look, the controls are
right here. It's perfect.

- Will it get hot enough?
- 220 degrees.

556
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,541
We just have to figure
out how to get him in here.

557
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,271
- Then we lock him in...
- Heat him up...

No matter what happens, we'll know.
