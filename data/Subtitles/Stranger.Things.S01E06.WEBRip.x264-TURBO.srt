Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here!

I'm right here! Nancy!

I just don't understand why
we're coming out here.

42
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,762
She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.

43
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:36,168
That's... that's not it.

44
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:39,922
Oh, really? Because no girl would
ever blow off King Steve.

45
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:42,675
She was acting weird. I
mean, something was wrong.

46
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:44,677
So what? [scoffs] Like,
you're worried about her?

47
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:48,180
- What?
- Aw, you are.

48
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:50,975
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just... Stop.

49
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:52,919
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up?

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,061
- Who knew?
- Shut up!

51
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:55,497
[chuckling] Jeez.

00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:59,501

[sighs] So this is it,
huh? Princess' castle.

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,054
[Steve] I'll just be a minute.

55
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:43,685
[Joyce] Look, we
gotta go through this again.

56
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:46,280
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

57
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:48,699
- Upstairs or downstairs?
- Upstairs.

58
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,909
There was a laboratory.

59
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,813
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

60
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:53,704
[inhales deeply]

61
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,206
There was this kid's room.

62
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,959
- How do you know it was a kid's room?
- More like a prison.

63
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,462
So why would you think it
was a kid's room, then?

64
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:02,922
Because, I told you,

65
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:04,557
the size of the
bed, there was a drawing,

66
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:05,716
there was a stuffed animal...

67
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,599
[stammers] You didn't
say there was a drawing.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,783
Yeah, there was a drawing
of a... an adult and a child.

69
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:11,764
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good?

70
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:14,099
It was a kid's drawing,
Joyce. It was stick figures.

71
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,493
[sighs]

72
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:21,875
Wasn't Will.

Earl...

74
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:34,912
The night that Benny died,

75
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:40,292
Earl said he saw some kid with
a shaved head with Benny.

76
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:44,129
Now, I pressed him, he said
it might be Will, but maybe...

77
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,006
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

78
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,425
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

79
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,594
she claims to have
lost her daughter, Jane.

80
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:53,097
She sued Brenner, she
sued the government...

81
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,575
Now, the claims came to
nothing, but what if...

82
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,770
I mean, what if this
whole time I've been...

83
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,539
I've been looking for Will...

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,584
I've been chasing after some other kid?

Better?

90
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:47,293
Yeah.

91
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:52,173
Is this okay? Uh, I
found it in the closet.

92
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:55,784
I can go home. [stammers]
I just figured...

93
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,846
Yeah, no. I... [stammers]

94
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,225
- I don't wanna be alone.

- Do you?
- No. Uh... no.

[sighs]

97
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:43,308
Can you just come up here?

98
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:49,898
Yeah.

99
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,745
- Do you want the lights off, or...
- [softly] On.

100
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:06,247
[softly] Yeah.

101
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,461
You know, it...

102
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:14,297
it can't get us in here.

103
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,262
We don't know that.

104
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,772
Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry
Ives. That's with a "Y."

105
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:32,792
Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on.

106
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:36,754
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:39,406
Mmm-hmm.

108
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:42,659
Great, thanks. I really
appreciate this, Frank.

109
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,762
Say hi to the boys
for me, too, would you?

110
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:53,796
Did you get it?

111
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,815
- I got it.
- Okay.

112

Oh...

115
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:19,881
Hey.

116
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,383
[Nancy] Hey.

117
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,595
[grunts] Couldn't sleep?

118
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:32,018
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

119
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:36,648
keep seeing that... thing.

120
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:41,152
Wherever I was, that place...

121
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:44,805
I think that it lives there.

122
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:46,741
It was feeding there.

123
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,869
Feeding on that deer.

124
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:53,313
That means that if... [inhales deeply]

125
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:55,833
if Will and Barbara...

126
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:00,922
Hey.

127
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,675
My mom said she talked to Will.

128
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:07,077
If he's alive, there's
a chance Barbara is, too.

129
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:09,180
That means that she's trapped...

130
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,599
in that place.

131
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,337
We have to find it again.

132
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,399
You wanna go back out there?

133
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,275
Maybe we don't have to.

134
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,636
When I saw it, it was
feeding on that deer.

135
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:27,848
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
- Right.

136
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:32,019
And it seems to hunt at
night, like a... a lion or a coyote.

137
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,830
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

138
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:37,083
It's always alone, like...

139
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,192
like a bear.

140
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:42,613
And remember at
Steve's, when Barb cut herself?

141
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:46,283
- And then, last night, the deer...
- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

142
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,593
One sec.

143
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:51,038
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

144
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,081
That's one drop of blood in a million,

145
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:55,417
and they can smell it from
a quarter mile away.

146
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:58,187
So you're saying it can detect blood?

147
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,274
[softly] It's just a theory.

148
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:04,277
We could test it.

149
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,489
But if it works...

150
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,367
At least we'll know it's coming.

Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

154
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:22,361
[Karen] I, uh, made some
blueberry pancakes.

- The very same.

164
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,896
Oh, wonderful.

165
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:01,483
And we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

166
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:03,485
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

167
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:06,488
as well as how-to articles, which
the kids write themselves.

168
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:07,990
Oh, that's neat.

169
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,974
What we're really
trying to do here, Mr. Clarke...

170
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:11,368
Uh, please, call me Scott.

171
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:12,995
Scott.

172
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:16,999
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is
to connect kids from all over the state

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,084
and give them the
support and encouragement

174
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,169
to pursue careers in technology.

175
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,073
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

176
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:26,591
I agree, yes. Completely.

177
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:29,678
So, you know any kids you
think might wanna participate?

178
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,490
Oh, I have a few in mind.

179
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,944
[Mike sighs] I just... I can't
believe she didn't come back.

180
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:48,030
- [Dustin] She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

181
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,657
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

182
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,909
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.

183
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,293
I shouldn't have yelled at
her. I never should've done that.

184
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,914
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

185
00:13:57,915 --> 00:13:59,136
It wasn't his fault, either.

186
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:02,294
- It wasn't his fault?
- No.

187
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:04,087
So you're saying he
wasn't way out of line?

188
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,714
- Totally, but so were you!
- What?

189
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:07,466
- And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break!

190
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,717
No, Mike, you give me a break!

191
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:11,261
All three of you were
being a bunch of little assholes!

192
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:12,888
I was the only reasonable one.

193
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,640
But the bottom line
is... you pushed first.

194
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,601
And you know the
rule. You draw first blood...

195
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,436
No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.

196
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:21,063
- You're shaking his hand!
- No, I'm not.

197
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:24,191
This isn't a
discussion. This is the rule of law.

198
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:28,087
Obey or be banished from the
party. Do you wanna be banished?

199
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:30,047
- No.
- Good.

200
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,658
Where are we going?

201
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,036
Where do you think? We're
going to get Lucas.

202
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:38,055
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

203
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:39,974
[door opens]

204
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,602
[breathing heavily]

205
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,741
Today is a very special day.

206
00:14:58,184 --> 00:14:59,535
Do you know why?

207
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:05,291
Because today, we make history.

208
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:09,378
Today, we make contact.

209
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,215
[breathing heavily]

210
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:17,053
[birds chirping]

211
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,329
[sighing]

212
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:50,211
[breathing heavily]

213
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:54,840
[screams]

214
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,302
[birds chirping]

215
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,039
[Karen] Here you go.

216
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,184
Ah... yum.

217
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,604
Okay. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

218
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:11,715
Where is Nancy? I thought
she was coming down.

219
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:14,009
[sighs] She is.

220
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,137
Uh, she was. I don't know.

221
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,598
- Nancy, what's taking so long?
- [music playing faintly]

222
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,308
Nancy?

223
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:24,078
- [door knob rattles]
- [sighs] Nancy, come on.

224
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:27,081
- [sighs]
- [music continues]

225
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,259
Nan...

226
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:55,359
[doorbell rings]

227
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,244
What do you want?

228
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:12,376
[sighs] I drew first blood, so...

229
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,477
Okay, I'll shake.

230
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,378
On one condition.

231
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:33,505
We forget the weirdo and
go straight to the gate.

232
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:35,006
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine!

233
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:36,800
- Fine!
- [Dustin] No, no, not fine!

234
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,194
Guys, seriously?

235
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:41,530
Do you even remember what
happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

236
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:48,436
[sighs] We couldn't agree on what
path to take, so we split up the party

237
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:50,438
and those trolls took us out one by one.

238
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:53,250
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

239
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:56,194
So we stick together, no matter what!

240
00:17:56,195 --> 00:18:01,199
Yeah, I agree. But this is the
party, right here in this room.

241
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,203
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

242
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,539
Never will be. She's
a liar, a traitor...

243
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,416
She was just trying to keep us safe!

244
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,320
She didn't mean to hurt
you. It was an accident!

245
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,335
An accident?

246
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,379
All right, accident or not...

247
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,506
- admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome?

248
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:18,508
Yeah, she threw you in
the air with her mind!

249
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:20,302
I could have been killed!

250
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:23,179
Which is exactly why we
need her. She's a weapon!

251
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,843
Do you seriously wanna fight the
Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

252
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,809
That's like R2-D2 going
to fight Darth Vader.

253
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,787
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

254
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:33,940
If you two wanna waste your
time looking for a traitor, go ahead,

255
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:37,336
'cause I'm not spending my
time on her anymore. No way!

256
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,799
I'm going to the
gate. I'm gonna find Will.

257
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:02,528
[upbeat music playing on PA]

258
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:10,286
[indistinct chatter]

259
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:18,568
[Dr. Brenner] It's okay, Eleven.

260
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:22,131
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

261
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,301
They're just here to watch.

262
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:29,162
Don't focus on them.

263
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:31,807
Stay in here, like before.

264
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,477
Yes, Papa.

265
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:42,926
Now, remember. Whatever
it is, it can't hurt you.

266
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:46,614
Not from here. So there's
nothing to be frightened of.

267
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:49,825
It's reaching out to you...

268
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,727
'cause it wants you.

269
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:54,437
Hmm?

270
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:55,748
It's calling you...

271
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,584
so don't turn away from it this time.

272
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:01,003
I want you to find it.

273
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:03,172
Understand?

274
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:05,174
Yes.

275
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:40,835
[man] Are you lost?

276
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:45,631
Is your mom here?

277
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:49,301
Your dad?

278
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,263
Mouth breather.

279
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:07,403
- What should we do?
- Uh...

280
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,865
Call the police.

281
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:17,896
Excuse me. Young lady! You
know you have to pay for those!

282
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:19,689
- Hey! Stop right...
- [woman screams]

283
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,191
- Please.
- [woman grunts]

284
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,359
[stammers] You have to pay for those!

285
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,963
Stop right there! Thief! Thief!

286
00:21:26,864 --> 00:21:28,799
- [glass shattering]
- [clamoring]

287
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:53,556
Can I help you?

288
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,683
Hi, we're looking for Terry
Ives. Does she live here?

289
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:58,746
- Who's asking?
- The Hawkins chief of police.

290
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:05,443
And you want to talk to my sister?

291
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:08,380
Well, if your sister's Terry
Ives, then, yeah, we do.

292
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:12,033
Okay, well, you can come in,

293
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:14,244
but if you want
Terry to tell you anything,

294
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:16,412
you're about five years too late.

295
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,915
[TV playing indistinctly]

296
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,893
Terry, you have some visitors.

297
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:25,505
Hello. My name's Joyce Byers.

298
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:28,633
Uh, this is Hopper. We
drove over from Hawkins.

299
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:32,095
Um, you see, uh, my son...

300
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:35,431
he's been missing for almost a week now,

301
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:38,685
and, um, we were
wondering if we could talk to you

302
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,395
about your daughter, Jane?

303
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:44,500
If there's anything that you could
tell us about when she was taken...

304
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,294
What was your
relationship with Dr. Brenner?

305
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:49,588
You guys keep in touch?

306
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,284
This is, uh... this is him.

307
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,828
[stammering] This is Will.

308
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:59,664
Uh, you may have seen
him on... on the news.

309
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:02,000
- Uh...
- What's wrong with her?

310
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,812
I told you, you're wasting your time.

311
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,999
[Dustin] This is weird without Lucas.

312
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,978
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.

313
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:48,021
What are you talking about?

314
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:52,651
[sighs] Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

315
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:56,512
He's your best friend, right?

316
00:23:56,513 --> 00:24:00,600
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine. I get it.

317
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:02,377
I didn't get here
until the fourth grade.

318
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:04,187
He had the
advantage of living next door.

319
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:05,605
But none of that matters.

320
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:08,358
What matters is that
he is your best friend.

321
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,921
And then this girl shows up and
starts living in your basement,

322
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:12,985
and all you ever want to
do is pay attention to her.

323
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,323
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. And you know it.

324
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:17,992
And he knows it. But no
one ever says anything

325
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:20,536
until you both start
punching and yelling at each other

326
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:23,081
like goblins with
intelligence scores of zero.

327
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:25,833
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.

328
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:29,587
- [chuckles] Yeah, right.
- [sighs] I mean, he is, but so are you.

329
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:32,090
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.

330
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,883
- Says who?
- Says logic.

331
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:37,571
Well, I call bull on your logic, because
you're my best friend, too.

332
00:24:38,472 --> 00:24:39,597
Okay.

333
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:41,742
[panting]

334
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:45,228
Whoa.

335
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:47,605
- [indistinct conversations]
- [Dustin] You don't think...

336
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:50,125
[panting] Uh... definitely.

337
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:03,871
[audience applauding on TV]

338
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:05,289
[host on TV] Are you ready?

339
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,126
[Becky] She was a part
of some study in college.

340
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:10,586
- MK Ultra?
- Yeah, that's the one.

341
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:14,424
[exhales] Was, uh, started in the '50s.

342
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:15,925
By the time Terry got involved,

343
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:19,220
it was supposed to be ramping
down, but the drugs just got crazier.

344
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:20,847
Messed her up good.

345
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:23,283
This was the CIA that ran this?

346
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,980
You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

347
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,523
[sighing] They'd pay... you know,

348
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:33,568
a couple hundred bucks to
people like my sister,

349
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:37,321
give 'em drugs,
psychedelics. LSD, mostly.

350
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:41,200
And then they'd strip her naked and
put her in these isolation tanks.

351
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:43,119
- Isolation tanks?
- [Becky] Yeah.

352
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,246
These big bathtubs, basically,

353
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,957
filled with salt water, so
you can float around in there.

354
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,710
You lose any sense of, uh...

355
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:54,589
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

356
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,967
They wanted to expand the
boundaries of the mind.

357
00:25:57,968 --> 00:25:59,427
Real hippie crap.

358
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:02,096
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

359
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:03,431
The thing is, though, is that

360
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,600
she didn't know she was
pregnant at the time.

361
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,202
Jane.

362
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:09,538
[sighs]

363
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:13,083
Do you have any pictures of her?

364
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:18,171
I don't think you guys understand.

365
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:21,466
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

366
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:29,665
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

367
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,809
[sighs]

368
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,755
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

369
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:38,633
- like she's gonna come home someday.
- [lullaby plays from mobile]

370
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:43,197
Says she's special. Born
with "abilities."

371
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,074
Abilities?

372
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:48,935
[bones cracking]

373
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:50,728
You read any Stephen King?

374
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:52,497
- [hisses]
- [beeping]

375
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:54,524
[stammers]

376
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:55,942
[chuckles]

377
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:58,361
You guys look scared, actually.

378
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:01,298
[chuckles] I mean,
it's all make-believe.

379
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:04,200
[clears throat] What...
what kind of abilities?

380
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,994
Telepathy, telekinesis...

381
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:08,704
[Eleven screams]

382
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:10,891
You know, shit you
can do with your mind.

383
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,919
That's why the big,
bad Man stole Jane away.

384
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,462
[yelling] Papa!

385
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:19,549
Her baby's a weapon, off
fighting the commies.

386
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,803
You know, the doctors all
say it's a coping mechanism.

387
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,596
You know, to deal with the guilt.

388
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:28,659
Do you think there is any
chance she could be telling the truth?

389
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:32,019
[stammering] About having had the kid.

390
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,897
There is no birth
certificate, nothing from the hospital.

391
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:38,067
Doctors and nurses all
confirm that she miscarried.

392
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:41,338
Yeah, but that could've
been covered up. Right?

393
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:45,342
Like I said, you and
Terry would've gotten along.

394
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:09,432
Oh, man.

395
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:10,993
[grunts]

396
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,464
[clattering]

397
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:02,210
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

398
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:12,078
What you kids doin' with all this?

399
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,513
Um...

400
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,377
- Monster hunting.
- Huh. [scoffs]

401
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,604
[cash register dings]

402
00:29:22,422 --> 00:29:23,774
"Monster hunting"?

403
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:28,153
You know, last week...

404
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,056
I was shopping for a new
top I thought Steve might like.

405
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:33,975
It took me and Barb all weekend.

406
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:37,937
It seemed like life or death,
you know? And... and now...

407
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:40,582
You're shopping for bear
traps with Jonathan Byers.

408
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,626
Yeah.

409
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,128
What's the weirdest part?

410
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:47,464
Me or the bear trap?

411
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:50,700
You. It's definitely you.

412
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,201
[chuckles]

413
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:54,054
- [car horn honking]
- [Reed] Hey, Nance!

414
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,623
Can't wait to see your movie. [laughs]

415
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,101
What the hell was that?

416
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,895
I don't know.

417
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:06,650
What?

418
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:10,845
What?

419
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:12,531
Hey! Where are you going?

420
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:16,868
- [panting]
- Nancy, wait!

421
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:19,287
[whimpers]

422
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,748
Nancy!

423
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,299
- [man 1] I can't believe it.
- [man 2] These kids!

424
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:33,718
- [Jonathan] Jesus.
- [sighs]

425
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,140
Wow.

426
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:43,294
- [spray can hissing]
- [Tommy laughing]

427
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:44,420
[Jonathan] Wait!

428
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:46,088
[Carol] Tommy, you write
like a three-year-old.

429
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,472
- [Tommy] Shut up!
- [Nicole] I didn't know you could spell.

430
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,653
[Tommy speaks indistinctly]

431
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:52,803
[indistinct chatter]

432
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:54,114
[laughter]

433
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:57,200
Aw, hey there, princess!

434
00:30:57,893 --> 00:30:59,870
[Tommy] Uh-oh! She looks upset.

435
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,397
- [Carol] Oh!
- [Tommy] Damn!

436
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:04,815
What is wrong with you?

437
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:06,559
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

438
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,818
I was worried about you.

439
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:10,322
I can't believe that I was actually
worried about you. [scoffs]

440
00:31:10,323 --> 00:31:13,324
- What are you talking about?
- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

441
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:16,577
You don't want to be known as
the lying slut now, do you?

442
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:17,888
Speak of the devil.

443
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:20,223
Hi.

444
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,059
You came by last night?

445
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,629
Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize?

446
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,465
Look, I don't know what you think
you saw, but it wasn't like that.

447
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:32,927
What, you just let him
into your room to... study?

448
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:35,596
Or for another pervy
photo session? [laughs]

449
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:37,460
- We were just...
- [Steve] You were just what?

450
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,146
Finish that sentence.

451
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:43,872
Finish the sentence.

452
00:31:44,648 --> 00:31:46,667
[breathing heavily]

453
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:52,381
[scoffs] Go to hell, Nancy.

454
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:54,573
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

455
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:56,200
You know what, Byers? I'm
actually kind of impressed.

456
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:58,344
I always took you for a
queer, but I guess you're just

457
00:31:58,345 --> 00:31:59,912
a little screw-up like your father.

458
00:31:59,913 --> 00:32:02,665
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
that house is full of screw-ups.

459
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,250
You know, I guess I
shouldn't really be surprised.

460
00:32:04,251 --> 00:32:05,543
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

461
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:06,794
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom...

462
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:08,712
I'm not even surprised what
happened to your brother.

463
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:09,839
[Nancy] Steve, shut up!

464
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,923
I'm sorry I have to
be the one to tell you,

465
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:13,347
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire...

466
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:13,944
[grunts]

467
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:16,238
- [groans]
- [Jonathan breathing heavily]

468
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,347
- [grunts]
- [Nancy] Steve!

469
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:20,099
- [Tommy] Oh!
- [both grunting]

470
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,785
- [Nancy] Steve.
- [groans]

471
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:24,603
Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!

472
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:26,867
- [Carol] Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

473
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,968
- [Carol] Get off! Stop!
- [both continue grunting]

474
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,569
Get in there, he's going
to hurt himself!

475
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,423
Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get

[softly] What?

504

We're gonna find him.

505
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:56,338
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

506

We're close.

507
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:04,286
[breath trembling] Twelve years? Twelve
years she's been looking for her...

508
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:06,289
And then she shows up at
Benny's five nights ago,

509
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,582
which means we've got a chance.

510
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,142
You know what I would give?

511
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:12,419
For a chance?

Yeah, a fight broke out here and...

516
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:24,098
- Cal, I don't have time for this.
- It's Jonathan Byers.

You haven't seen Joyce, have you?

00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:41,031
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

519

You, yes. Him, no.

520
00:34:43,243 --> 00:34:45,578
He assaulted a police officer.

You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

523
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,459
[chuckles] He's not my boyfriend.

524
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,063
I think you better tell him that.

525
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:56,797
What?

526
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,651
Only love makes you
that crazy, sweetheart.

I want to know how you did it!

- How I did what?
- [Dustin whimpers]

571
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,625
I know you did something to me.

00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:26,524
Some nerdy science
shit to make me do that.

- Shut up!
- [groaning]

00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:36,892
I think I should save Toothless
here a trip to the dentist.

578
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:38,685
Help him lose the
rest of his baby teeth.

579

Let him go. Let him go!

I'll let him go, sure.

- But first... it's your turn.
- [panting]

Wet yourself.

- Jump...

585
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:53,575
or Toothless here gets an
early trip to the dentist.
