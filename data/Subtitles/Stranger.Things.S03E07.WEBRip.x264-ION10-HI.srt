you built a time machine...

[Alexei speaking Russian]

305

312
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,283

there is a vault.

313
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,127
- [speaking Russian]
- And to open the vault,

314
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,462
you need to enter Planck's constant.

315
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,418
- Planck's what?
- Planck's constant.

316
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,168
- It's a very famous number.
- All right, so we get the keys,

317
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,091
and then we turn the machine off.

318
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,380
That's what he says.

319
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,223
All right, well, that shouldn't be
too hard. We can do this.

320
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,485
Joyce, did you hear the part
where he said the place was like

321
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,589
an impenetrable fortress?

322
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,507
Yeah, but there has to be a way in.

323
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,926
Yeah, there is. Our military.

324
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,054
- Who are coming.
- Well, we don't know that anymore

325
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,739
because you yelled at them
like it was a parent-teacher conference,

326
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,650
and then you hung up on them,
so we don't know what the hell's going on,

327
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,570
because now we're...
Wait, wait, what are we do... Oh!

328
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,030
Wait, that's right!

329
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,609
We're on our way to rescue our children

330
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,696
from the big, bad
Fourth of July celebration!

331
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,293
You know what, if you can't handle this,
then just turn around

332
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,540
and drop me off first.

333
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,041
What are you gonna do?

334
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,252
You gonna walk back to Hawkins?

335
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,843
I will do anything
if it gets me away from you!

336
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,089
Children! Children! Children!

337
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,756
This interminable bickering
was amusing at first,

338
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,312
but it's getting very stale and we've
still got a long drive ahead of us.

339
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,139
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit

340
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,975
and get to the part where you admit
your sexual feelings for one another?

341
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,522
- Whoa!
- You are way off base, buddy!

342
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,066
Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me!

343
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,531
Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know.

344
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,572
Probably reminds you
of a bad relationship,

345
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,156
and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man
to settle down with,

346
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,373
but, admit it, you're real curious to know
what he's like in the sack.

347
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,541
And you. Ha!

348
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,794
Well, you're just a big manbaby

349
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,296
who'd rather act tough
than show his true feelings,

350
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,468
because the last time
you opened your heart, you got hurt.

351
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,380
Owie.

352
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,717
And now, rather than admit these feelings,
you're dancing around one another

353
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,885
with this mind-numbing
and frankly boorish mating ritual.

354
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,805
So, please, for my sake,

355
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,194
either quit your bickering, or pull over,

356
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,982
tear off those clothes,

357
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,105

I told them they should have sex.

362
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,581

00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,998
No.

Okay, get her down.

[Nancy] Okay.

00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,805
I'm cleaning the wound.

381
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,719
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding,

382
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,228
then clean, then disinfect, then bandage.

Keep the pressure on it,

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,730
We're gonna need water, soap.

388
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,405
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

389
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,616
Does any of this help?

390
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,786
No.

391
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,293
Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.

392
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,377
- A bowl?
- Lucas.

393
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,416
- Go.
- [stammers] Okay.

[groans]

395
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,100
[Nancy] What did that thing
look like to you?

396
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,184
Like that thing in the hospital,
only bigger.

397
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,431
Yeah, a lot bigger.

398
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,852
Like, Tom and Bruce,
they merged to become one, right?

399
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,493
And... And Driscoll kept saying
how she needed to go back to the source...

400
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,517
Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?

401
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,023
Maybe.

402
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,574
And... And... And maybe Heather and Janet,
too, and God knows who else.

403
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,170
I don't know how we're gonna
kill this thing, but if we do...

404
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,034
- We kill all the flayed.
- And... we end this.

405
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,532
Maybe.

406
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,954
All I know is...

407
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,911
we need El.

408
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,496
[Lucas] Bowl...

409
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,248
Bowl...

Bowl...

411
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,998
- Why wouldn't it be with the cereal?
- I don't know.

412
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,761
What else do you use a bowl for?

413

Satan's Baby.

417
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,521
You ever shot one of these suckers?

418
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,225
No. Is it sweet?

419
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,290
- That's an understatement.
- [Max] That doesn't look like a bowl.

420
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,316
Nah, it's way better.

421
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,323
There is a reason this warning label
says "18 or older."

422
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:04,201
This sucker is filled with 150 grains
of black powder.

423
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,120
AKA gunpowder.

424
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,132
Strap two of these together,
and it's bigger than an M-80.

425
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,584
Five of them,

426
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,674
we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.

427
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,165
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?

428
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,627
Do you have a better idea?

429
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,217
Uh, yeah. Eleven.

430
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,353
Against that thing?
She's gonna need some backup.

431
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,102
- Oh, my God.
- [Lucas scoffs]

432

Does that hurt?

435

Uh, not bad.

436
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,986
You're gonna have an awesome scar.

437
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,158
You'll look even more badass.

I've been meaning to tell you something.

444

It's just, being broken up,

I like that you and Max are friends now.

449
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,310
It's just, I was jealous at first,
and... and angry.

450
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,481
And that's why I said
all that stupid stuff.

451
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,649
And it's like I wanted you all to myself.

452
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,653
And now I realize how unfair that is.

453

And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry.

454

it makes you crazy.

"blank makes you crazy," like the word...

- "Girlfriends"?
- No, no, no, no, not... not girlfriends.

- "Boyfriends."
- No! No, no, not boyfriends either.

I mean, I actually was mad,

but it's also because
I was trapped underground

Do you have any batteries? Double-A?

00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,883
Why would I have batteries?

498
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,129
I always carry batteries.

499
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,461
Then what's the problem?

500
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,625
I need eight.

Eight?

Then why is it called Back to the Future?

516
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,678
He has to go back to the future

517
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,679
because he's in the past.

518

00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,940
[Hopper] Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go!

985
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,784
Alexei?

986
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,963
[man on radio, in Russian]
On the lower level...

987
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,748
Hey, translate.

988
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,169
We've found the children.

989
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,498
They are still in the mall. Lower level.

990
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,419
[in Russian]
Keep all entrances locked down.

991
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,337
I repeat...

992
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,385
Keep all entrances locked down.

993
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,623
[squeaking sound]

994
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,126
[quietly] Everyone, get over here.

995
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,512
I found them.

996
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,881
[kids panting]

997
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,034
[panting]

998
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,350
- [car alarm wailing]
- [all gasping]

999
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,001
[horn honking]

1000
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,214
[in Russian] What the hell?

1001
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,627
[intense synth music playing]

1002
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,394
[men groaning]

1003
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,064

00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,685
[metal clattering]

1005
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,366
[dramatic synth music playing]

1006
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,843
[laughing] You flung that thing
like a Hot Wheel!

1007
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,216
[Dustin grunts]

1008
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,764
- Lucas?
- What are you doing here?

1009
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,175
Ask them. It's their fault.

1010
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,473
True, yeah. Totally true.
It's absolutely our fault.

1011
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,118
I don't understand what happened
to that car.

1012
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,182
El has superpowers.

1013
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,246
- [Robin] I'm sorry?
- Superpowers. She threw it with her mind.

1014
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,940
- C'mon, catch up.
- That's El?

1015
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,152
- Who's El?
- I'm sorry, who are you?

1016
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,902
- I'm Robin. I work with Steve.
- She cracked the top secret code.

1017
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,879
Yeah, which is how we found out
about the Russians.

1018
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,203
Russians? Wait, what Russians?

1019
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,160
- The Russians!
- Those were Russians?

1020
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,330
- Some of them.
- What are you talking about?

1021
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,886
- Didn't you hear our code red?
- Yeah.

1022
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,510
- Couldn't understand what you were saying.
- Goddamn low battery.

1023
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,599
How many times do I have to tell you
with the low battery?

1024
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,183
Well, everything worked out, didn't it?

1025
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,420
- Worked out? We almost died.
- Yeah, but we didn't, did we?

1026
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,303
- [Steve] It was pretty damn close.
- [Lucas] Okay, Russians?

1027
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,631
As in, they're working for
the Russian government?

1028
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,112
- [Eleven panting]
- [Dustin] What are you not comprehending?

1029
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,386
Am I not speaking English?

1030
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,141
- We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation.
- [droning sound]

1031
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,143
[Max] So this has nothing to do
with the gate?

1032
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,475
[Dustin] It has everything to do
with the gate...

1033
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,191
[droning sound intensifies]

1034
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,771
[Eleven grunts, groans]

1035
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,728
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1036
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,975
- El! El!
- [whimpering]

1037
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,670
- [Erica] What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong?

1038
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,114
My leg. My leg.

1039
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,106
Her leg, her leg. Okay.

1040
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,357
[Eleven panting]

1041
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,448
- Get that off.
- Okay.

1042
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,700
[all exclaim in disgust]

1043
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,785
[Erica groans]

[wailing]

1048
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,830
El! El!

1049
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,838
[wailing]

1050
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,919
[Mike] El! El, are you okay?

1051
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,844
El! El!

1052
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,923
El!
