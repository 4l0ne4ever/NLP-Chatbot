[screaming] Shit! Shit!

4
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,225
We're going down! We're going down!

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,900
Yeah, no shit, Harrington!

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,229
- Why don't these buttons work?!
- [Steve screams]

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,032
[Erica] Press the button!

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,648
What do you think I'm doing?!

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,025
Come on, press something!
Just press the button!

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,492
- [screams]
- [Erica] Push it!

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,572
- [crashing]
- [all grunting]

12
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,947
- [Steve] Oh!
- [Robin winces]

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,034
[Steve] My groin.

14
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,406
It fell on my groin.

15
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,584
Dustin! [strains]

16
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,212
- [Robin sighs]
- Get this off of me!

17
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,207
[Steve] I can't move.

18

[grunts]

19
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,252
Is everyone okay?

20
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,085
Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that
Russians can't design elevators!

21
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,973
I think we've clearly established
that those buttons don't work.

22
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,611
They're buttons.
They have to do something.

23
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,095
Yeah, if we had a keycard.

24
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,009
- A what?
- It's an electronic lock.

25
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,325
Same as the loading dock door.
If we don't have a keycard,

26
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,429
- it won't operate, meaning...
- We're stuck in here.

27
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,477
Yeah.

28
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,904
Just so you nerds are aware,

29
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,980
I'm supposed to be spending the night
at Tina's,

30
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,107
and Tina always covers for me.

31
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,284
But if I'm not home
for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow

32
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,283
and my mom finds out
you three are responsible,

33
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:19,246
she's gonna hunt you down, one by one,
and slit your throat.

34
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,289
I don't care about Tina!

35
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,462
Or Uncle Jack's party!

36
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:28,001
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us
if we're dead in a Russian elevator!

37
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,214
[Dustin] Hey.

38
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,882
What if we climbed out?

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,930
[Dustin's grunts echo]

40
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,858
[Steve exhales sharply]

41
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,864
What were you saying about climbing?

42
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,403
[Steve's voice echoes]

43
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,853
Looks like somebody's home.

[Hopper exhales sharply]

53
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,372
Where's that coming from?

[pulsing intensifies]

55
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,133

[speaking Russian]

72
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,855

[Hopper] Don't move!

83
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,172
Drop the gun.

84
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,798
Drop it!

85
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,684
You understand what I'm saying, big guy?

86
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,681
Drop the weapon.

87
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,883
[in Russian accent] Or what?

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,810
You going to shoot?

89
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,851
Good.

90
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,613
[Hopper] So you do understand
what I'm saying, huh?

91
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,808
And, yeah,

92

No.

You won't do that.

96
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,570
Why's that?

97
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,491
Because you are policeman.

98
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,583
Policemen have rules.

99
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,662
Oh, yeah?

I'm gonna count to three.

Listen to me, okay?

It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh, I had a late night

- I'm at the hospital with Driscoll.
- What?

00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,345
with your brother.

171
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,055
- What?
- Jonathan...

172
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,602
Please.

173
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,145
Uh...

174
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,362
He's not even here.

175
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Where is he?

176
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,150
Is he safe?

177
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,821
Why wouldn't he be safe?

178
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,570
Nancy?

179
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,872
Why wouldn't he be safe?

180
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,451
[steam hissing]

181
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,084
[Hopper] Son of a bitch.

182
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,285
Son of a bitch!

183
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,214
[Hopper coughs]

184
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,248
Okay, a magnet? Magnets?

185
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,377
- Do you know "magnet"? Magnet?
- [speaking Russian] Magnit.

186
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,625
Yes, magnit.

187
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,426
Okay, so, uh, magnit...

188
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,048
on my... my fridge,

189
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,546
my icebox, and then they...

190
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,352
they fell.

191
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,311
They demagnetized, stopped working.
Uh, do you understand?

192
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,233
Da.

193
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,110
Okay, so is that because of the machines
that you're working on?

194
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,189
- Machina.
- Machina, machina, yes.

195
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,284
[imitates revving engine]

196
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,359
Da, da, machina.

197
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,323
- Machina, machina!
- Yes, machina...

198
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,324
Vroom, vroom.

199
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,155
Oh, not... not the car.

200
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,580
The machines at Hess Farm where...

201
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,039
- where we kidnapped you...
- Joyce, please!

202
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
You're givin' me a headache, both of you!

203
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,923
Hold on, please. One minute.

204
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,998
[Joyce] Hey.

205
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,753
I am making progress.

206
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,205
- Progress.
- Yeah.

207
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,898
What have you learned, huh?
You learned that Smirnoff over there...

208
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,302
- [Joyce] Alexei.
- Smirnoff is Russian

209
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,933
and works for Starcourt,

210
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,219
two things we already knew.

211
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,142
Thought we knew.

212
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,100
But now we know-know,
because I've confirmed them.

213
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,181
You're welcome.

214
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,766
Yeah? Why don't you confirm
whether this baby'll start, huh?

215
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,813
- [Hopper] Keep it in park, please.
- Yeah, duh!

216
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,016
You do... do something useful.

217
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,028
- You do something useful.
- [sighs]

218
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,485
- [Joyce scoffs]
- [groans]

219
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,204
[engine turns over]

220
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,701
[electric crackling]

221
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,832
[sighs]

222
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,541
It's not working.

223
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,408
Try it again.

224
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,119
[engine turns over]

225
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,115
Shit.

226
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,206
[engine sputters]

227
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,961
- [electric crackling]
- Hey. Hey. [speaking Russian]

228
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,047
Stop, stop!

229
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,222
Shut up, Smirnoff!

230
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,840
[speaking Russian rapidly]

231
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,756
Aw, come on! D'you hear me?

232
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,255
I said shut your damn...

233
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,970
[high-pitched squealing]

234
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,056
Shit!

235
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,269
Oh, Jesus.

236
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,390
[Joyce gasps]

237
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,726
[Hopper] Whoa!

238
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,112
[gasps]

239
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,066
Stop.

240
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,861
[Joyce] I thought this friend of yours
lived in Illinois.

241
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,277
He's not really a friend.
He's more like an acquaintance.

242
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,576
Oh? Okay, well...

243
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,369
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep up, keep up, keep up.

244
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,754
- Easy.
- [insects buzzing]

245
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,040
Okay, so this acquaintance...

246
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,791
- lives in Illinois? Correct?
- [Hopper] Yeah, yeah.

247
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,747
[Joyce] So we're walking to Illinois?

248
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,757
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.

249
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,193
You know, I figure we'll get there
by, like, Friday evening.

250
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,445
I hope that works for your schedule.
Jesus Christ, Joyce.

251
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,114
- We're not walking to Illinois, okay?
- Well, then what are we doing?

252
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,138
I don't know, okay?

253
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,351
I will... I will figure something out.

254
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,483
Isn't there someone in Indiana
who speaks Russian that...

255
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,561
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.

256
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,477
I'm all ears.

257
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,564
I'm all ears!

258
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,529
[Joyce] I mean, fine.

259
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,109
Just saying.

260
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,204
Gah!

261
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,529
Ugh!

262
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,573
Gah!

263
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,662
[sighs]

264
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,124
[Hopper] Damn it.

265
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,997
I found him.

266
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,004
[Max] Where is he?

267
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,472
Woods.

268
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,930
- [TV static hissing]
- Woods?

269
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,009
He's with... Will's mom.

270
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,675
My... My mom?

271
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,519
What are they doing?

272
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,388
Ill... annoy.

273
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,563
They're going to Ill-annoy.

274
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,414
- [knocking on door]
- [Karen] Mike! Breakfast!

275
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,728
Not now, Mom!

276
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,435
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?

277
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,153
The state of Illinois?

278
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,492
[stammers] Ill-annoy.

279
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,449
[tap stops]

280
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,753
[Max] Does it still hurt?

281
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,207
Only when I talk.

282
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,924
Well, it's a good thing
you're not Mike, then.

283
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,795
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
And you'd be in constant pain.

284
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
[both chuckle]

285
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,100
[Mike] Something's not right.
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer,

286
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,809
now all of a sudden,
he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?

287
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,351
And Dustin's MIA, too?

288
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,314
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.

289
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,444
What does it matter?

290
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,730
The bottom line is, they're not here.

291
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,734
- It's up to us.
- Up to us to do what exactly?

292
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,357
Find Billy and stop him.

293
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,204
Okay, yeah,
that's a really nice sentiment,

294
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,619
but even if El could find him again,
and that's a pretty big if, then what?

295
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,460
We burn the shit out of him
and make sure he doesn't escape this time.

296
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,253
- Okay, then what?
- Then we win.

297
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,869
No, see, that's the problem.

298
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,865
We don't. We don't win.

299
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,686
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before
and he just came right back.

300
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,550
We don't just have to stop Billy,
we have to stop the Mind Flayer.

301
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,510
- How in the hell do we do that?
- I don't know.

302
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,668
Maybe El does.

303
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,215
What are they still doing in there?

304
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,057
I don't know.

305
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,439
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.

306
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,484
Why?

307
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,016
- I mean, I don't know.
- They're conspiring against me.

308
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,827
- That's what you're concerned about now?
- It's not my main concern.

309
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,172
- It's just a sub-concern.
- I thought it was already over.

310
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,366
It's not over, okay?
We're just taking a break.

311
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,988
She said she dumped your ass.

312
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,195
- That doesn't sound like a break.
- [Max] It wasn't!

313
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,155
You guys do realize we can still hear
everything you're saying, right?

314
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,617
[laughs]

315
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,044
[whispers] Conspiring.

316
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
- I told you, they're conspiring.
- [knock at door]

317
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,714
Not now, Mom!

318
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,456
[Nancy] Mike, open the door.

319
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,638
[Dustin] Code red, I repeat, code red.

320
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,010
Does anyone copy?

321
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,677
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.

322
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,346
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
Does anyone copy?

323
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,146
We are innocent children
and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.

324
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,231
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins,
and if we are found,

325
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,897
they will torture and kill us.

326
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,026
[Steve] Hey. [grunts]

327
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,393
Gotta take it easy on that thing.
Gonna drain the battery.

328
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,027
- The mall just opened.
- So?

329
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,576
So someone could be in range.

330
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,409
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop
is gonna rappel down here

331
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,495
and save the day?

332
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,259
All right, why are you such a cranky pants

333
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,169
after getting to spend the night
with Robin?

334
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,000
Shh! Jesus Christ.

335
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,335
Will you just give up
on your creepy dream already?

336
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,881
I heard you guys talking all night.

337
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,084
We were trying to figure out a way
to open up the door

338
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,763
while you children were sleeping.

339
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,180
After eight hours,

340
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,564
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,

341
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,558
you know, probably just a little bit
of the reason why I'm feeling just...

342
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,385
- a tad cranky.
- [unzipping sound]

343
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,476
What are you doing?

344
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,626
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm taking a leak. Look away.

345
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,690
Look away!

346
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,613

348
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,164
Can you redirect your stream, please?

349
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,623
[Robin's voice echoes]

350
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,788
Ugh.

351
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful!

352
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,782
We don't even know what that is.

353
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,377
Exactly. It could be useful.

354
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,844
Useful how?

355
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,183
We can survive down here a long time
without food,

356
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,389
but if the human body doesn't get water,
it will die.

357
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,761
I hate to break it to you,

358
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,597
but this is not water.

359
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,103
No, but it's a liquid,

360
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,975
and if it comes down to me
drinking that shit

361
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,402
or dying of thirst,

362
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,520
I drink.

363
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,436

[in Russian] You smell that?

372
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
[in Russian] What?

373
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,062
Piss.

Let's go.

378
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,266
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
- [Erica] I'm going!

379
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,113
- Henderson. Go, go.
- [vial buckles]

380
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,345
[Robin] Come on, Steve, let's go!

381
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,866
[sizzling]

382
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,994
- Jesus Christ.
- [Erica] Ooh!

383
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,539
You still wanna drink that?

384
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,746
Holy mother of God.

385
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,337
Well...

386
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,467
hope you guys are in good shape.

387
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,392
Looking at you, roast beef.

388
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,346
Let's go, come on.

389
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,765
Why me?

390
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,190
It was the same thing,

391
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,293
the exact same thing
that happened to Will last year.

392
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,857
And look at this.
Look at the body temperatures.

393
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,823
He likes it cold.

394
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,829
Okay, so this crazy old woman
who was eating fertilizer...

395
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,709
- Mrs. Driscoll.
- Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.

396
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,425
- What time was this attack?
- Last night.

397
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,865
Right, but what time last night?

398
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,955
- Around 9:00.
- You waited all night to call?

399
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,144
I was waiting for the doctors
to run some tests.

400
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,248
You weren't there?

401
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,626
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

402
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,592
Hallelujah!

403
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,671
Ooh.

404
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,933
Um, so, wha... what time was your...
sauna test?

405
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,049
[in unison] Around 9:00.

406
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,219
Well, that proves it.
That proves my theory.

407
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,675
She's flayed, just like Billy.

408
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,095
- Flayed?
- The Mind Flayer. He flays people.

409
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,194
Takes over their mind.

410
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,478
Once they do that,
they basically become him.

411
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,152
- If there are two flayed...
- We have to assume there are more.

412
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,322
Heather.

413
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,693
Billy was doing something to her.

[Heather whimpers echo]

415
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,823
She was scared.

416
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,778
She was screaming.

417
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,448
- [screams]
- Bad screams.

418
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,975
- What's a good scream?
- Max said...

419
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,957
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?

420
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,540
- She's a lifeguard at the pool.
- Heather Holloway?

You stink.

I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?

433
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,915
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?

434

Yeah, with me in it.

00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,709
Well, I just want to remind you
of something, Joyce.

436
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,134
- I am not a mechanic.
- Yeah, clearly.

437

That's why you should've listened
to Alexei.

438
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,335
Oh, right, yeah.
Your new boyfriend, right?

439
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,756
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on
has to be my boyfriend.

440
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,056
Yeah, he reminds me a bit
of a Russian Scott Clarke.

441

Oh, here we go.

442
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,476
Maybe you should go on a date.
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?

443
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,268
- Whoa.
- What?

This is a police emergency, all right?

I need to commandeer your vehicle.

in the world.

- murdered many children.
- What?

487

Oh, yes, he... very dangerous, uh,

494
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,790
forger... er.

495
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,699
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.

496
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,707
- Child murderer?
- We should really get going.

497
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,989
Hey, how do I get my car back?

498
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,791
- You just call the station.
- What station?

499
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,416
- [heavy metal resumes]
- Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!

500
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,514
Hey, what station?

501
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,258
You're doing the right thing!

502
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,340
[tires squealing]

503
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,295
Hey, what the... Hey!

504
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,137
Dude!

505
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,991
[Dustin] I mean, you have to admit,
as a feat of engineering alone,

506
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,360
this is impressive.

507
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,518
What are you talking about?
It's a total fire hazard.

508
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,025
There's no stairs, there's no exit,

509
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,295
there's just an elevator
that drops you halfway to hell.

510
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,149
They're Commies.

511
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,607
You don't pay people, they cut corners.

512
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,050
To be fair to our Russian comrades,

513
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,414
I don't think this tunnel was designed
for walking.

514
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,503
Think about it,
they developed the perfect system

515
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,698
for transporting that cargo.

516
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,746
It all comes into the mall
like any old delivery.

517
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,431
And then they load it up onto those trucks
and nobody's the wiser.

518
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,937
[Steve] You think
they built this whole mall

519
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,171
so they could transport
that green poison?

520
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,715
I very seriously doubt
it's something as boring as poison.

521
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,027
It's gotta be much more valuable,
like promethium or something.

522
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,341
What the hell is promethium?

523
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,887
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make
Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.

524
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,853
You're all so nerdy,
it makes me physically ill.

525
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,614
No, no, no.
No, don't lump me in with them.

526
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,694
I'm not a nerd, all right?

527
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,440
[Robin] Why so sensitive, Harrington?

528
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,583
Afraid of losing cool points
to a ten-year-old child?

529
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,237
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit
about Prometheus.

530
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,148
[Dustin] Promethium.

531
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,736
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure,
but whatever. All I'm saying is,

532
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,833
it's probably being used
to make something.

533
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,158
Or power something.

534
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,123
- Like a nuclear weapon?
- Totally.

535
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,293
Walking towards a nuclear weapon.
That's great.

536
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,712
- That'd be great.
- But if they're building something,

537
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,831
why here?

538
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,297
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places.

539
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,629
At the very best, we're a toilet stop
on your way to Disneyland,

540
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,926
but maybe that's it.
Maybe it's our very...

541
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,529
- You think the Russians know?
- About...

542
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,853
- They could.
- So it's connected?

543
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,060
- Maybe.
- How?

544
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,558
I don't know, but it's...

545
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
[both] Possible.

546
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,953
I'm sorry, is there something you'd
like to share with the class?

547

00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,212
It's the code.

554
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,711
- Wherever that broadcast is coming from...
- It's close.

555
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,688
And if there's one thing we know
about that signal...

556
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,302
It can reach the surface.

557
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Let's go.

00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,598
Oh.

567

Oh, God.

568
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,435
More chemicals.

569
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,068
You think they're guzzling this shit?

570
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,716
Yeah, either that or they just went on
a hell of a cleaning spree.

571
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,830
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.

- No.

Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit.

You create a new substance.

it's taking place somewhere else?

599
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,689
There must be a place
where all this started, right?

600
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,651
A source.

601

Or at least stop it from spreading

with those chemicals.
