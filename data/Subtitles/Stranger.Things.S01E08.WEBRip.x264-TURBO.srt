00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,734
[Dr. Brenner] Your son.

9
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:52,029
We know you've been in contact with him.

10
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:57,159
- [stammering] You have to let me...
- When...

11
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:00,871
and how did you make contact with him?

12
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:03,666
- What?
- Hmm?

13
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:06,960
Six.

14
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,338
What?

15
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,965
Six.

16
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,261
Six people have been taken this week.

17
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,891
This... thing that took your son...

18
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:24,919
[softly] we don't really understand it.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,523
But its behavior is predictable.

20
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:31,693
Like all animals...

21
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,030
it eats.

22
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:38,283
It will take more sons.

23
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,369
More daughters.

24
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,038
I want to save them.

25
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,583
I want to save your son.

26
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:49,253
But I can't do that.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,404
Not without your help.

28
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:52,715
Stop.

29
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,387
I know who you are.

30
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:00,931
I know what you've done.

31
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:05,209
You took my boy away from me!

32
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,047
You left him in that place to die!

33
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:11,150
You faked his death!

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,344
We had a funeral.

35
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:16,822
We buried him.

36
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,993
And now you're asking for my help?

37
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,665
Go to hell.

- Okay, now what do you know?

40
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,884
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:38,969
Did I stutter?

42
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,080
I told you.

43
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,539
Everything.

44
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,975
[electricity crackling]

45
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,212

[panting]

47
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:53,216
I know you do
experiments on kidnapped little kids,

48
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:55,694
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

49
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,346
And I know you went a
little too far this time

50
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,365
and you messed up in a big way.

51
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:04,477
I mean, you really messed
up, didn't you? Big time.

52
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:06,497
That's why you're
trying to cover your tracks.

53
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:10,525
You killed Benny Hammond, you
faked Will Byers' death.

54
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,027
You made it look like that
little girl just ran away.

55
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:14,546
See, I told you.

56
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,217
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

57
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:20,493
Nobody.

58
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:22,745
But I did give all this over
to my friend at the Times.

59
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:24,649
He's gonna blow this
thing wide open. [chuckles]

A small town cop who
had a really bad week.

Took one too many pills this time.

65
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,019
You made a mistake coming back here.

66
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,705
No, I didn't.

67
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,042
Here's what's gonna happen.

68
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,671
You're gonna let me
and Joyce Byers go...

69
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,948
you're gonna give us anything we need,

70
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:01,093
and we're gonna find her son.

71
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:05,872
And then we're gonna forget that
any of this ever happened.

72
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:08,100
Oh, is that right?

73
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:10,686
Yeah.

74
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,856
That's right.

75
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:29,580
Nancy? Jonathan?

[door closes]

77
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,490
- They're gone.
- What?

78
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,906
Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.

79
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:41,690
They're probably just
sucking face somewhere.

80
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,534
- [Lucas] Gross.
- No. No way!

81
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:44,702
Did they go with the chief?

82
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,804
I don't know.

83
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:47,514
No.

84
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:50,893
What? Did you see them? Do
you know where they went?

85
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,187
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

86
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:58,317
Demogorgon.

You gotta give me your word.

Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

93
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:06,278
And those other three kids, those
boys, you're gonna leave them alone.

94
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:10,407
Then I'll tell you.

95
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:15,704
Tell you where your little
science experiment is.

We came to an agreement.

What?

101
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:48,537
Look, everything that's happened
here and everything that's gonna happen,

we don't talk about.

You want Will back?

104
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:53,784
This place had nothing to do with it.

105
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:57,412
That's the deal. You got it?

106
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,322
What is this?

107
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:11,242
Protection. The atmosphere is toxic.

108
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:13,703
[stutters] But my son's in there. He...

109
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:14,930
Put it on.

110
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,023
[Connie] I'm telling
you, this is a mistake.

111
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:34,150
[Dr. Brenner] It's gone. Isn't
that what you wanted?

112
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:35,641
And if they find the boy?

113
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:37,327

00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:04,368
Exactly. We stay here, keep El
out of sight and keep her safe.

169
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,245
That's the most
important thing, remember?

170
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:08,247
Besides, she's
okay. She's with Jonathan.

171
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,767
Yeah, and she's kind
of a badass now, so...

172
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,128
Well, where are you going? You
just said stick to the plan!

173
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,588
I am. I'm just gonna go
get some chocolate pudding.

174
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,757
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady
Phyllis hoards that shit.

175
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,092
[Mike] Are you serious?

176
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:21,861
El needs to be recharged!

177
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,240
[door opens]

[faint creaking]

180
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,092
Did you hear that?

181
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,346
It's just the wind.

182
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,461
Don't worry.

183
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:58,881
My mom, she said the
lights speak when it comes.

184
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:00,066
Speak?

185
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,176
Blink.

186
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:04,362
Think of them as alarms.

187
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:14,915
Is that too tight?

188
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,274
[stutters] No, it's fine.

189
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,585
Thanks.

190
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,139
Nancy?

191
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,601
Yeah?

192
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,633

193
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,547
[Steve] Jonathan?

194
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,984
Are you there, man? It's... it's Steve!

195
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,552
Listen, I just want to talk!

196
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:46,863
[banging on door continues]

197
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,283
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

198
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:51,029
You need to leave.

199
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,768
I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

200
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,472
I don't care about
that. You need to leave.

201
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:57,439
[stammering] No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

202
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,191
I messed... I messed up.

203
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:00,275
Okay?

204
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,111
Really. Please.

205
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:03,755
I just want to make things right.

206
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:07,133
Okay? Please. Please...

207
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:09,243
[stammers]

208
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:10,619
Hey, what happened to your hand?

209
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,954
Is that blood?

210
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:13,789
Nothing. [stutters] It was an accident.

211
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,749
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

212
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,626
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

213
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:20,021
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

214
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:23,048
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

215
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:24,925
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

216
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,552
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

217
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,456
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

218
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:30,848
[stutters] Wait. What? What is going on?

219
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,224
You have five
seconds to get out of here.

220
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:34,008
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

221
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:35,602
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

222
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,306
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

223
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:38,939
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

224
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,750
Nancy! The lights.

225
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,610
- It's here.
- [Steve] Wait, what's here?

226
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:44,695
- [Nancy] Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

227
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,280
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

228
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:47,448
I don't know. I don't see it.

229
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:48,532
Where is what?

230
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,386
Hello? Will someone please
explain to me what the hell is going...

231
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:56,758
- [monster roars]
- [Jonathan] No!

232

Go! Go! Run! Go!

233
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:00,437

- [Steve] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

236
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:08,969
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

237
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,673
- What the hell was that?
- [both] Shut up!

[Nancy] What's it doing?

241
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,624
I don't know.

242
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:29,716
[electricity jolts]

243
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,681
Do you hear anything?

No.

[Hopper] "I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know

253
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:08,630
and for pity's sake not to
ask her any more questions.

254
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:10,614
She said I must have asked
her a thousand already.

255
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:11,717
I suppose I had, too,

256
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:14,803
but how are you gonna find things
out if you don't ask questions?

257

And what does make roads red?

Where's it going?

I don't think that's the monster.

316
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,304
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.

317
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,722
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

318
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:52,265
Always lying, saying she's out.

319
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,933
Bald-faced liar.

320
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:57,312
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

321
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:58,789
Okay!

322
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,083
Are you feeling any better?

What's "putting"?

325
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,198
[chuckles] Pudding, it's...

326
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:10,059
it's this chocolate
goo you eat with a spoon.

327
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,368
Don't worry,

328
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,832
when all this is over, you
won't have to keep eating junk food

329
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,372
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

330
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:17,624
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.

00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,209
She can make you whatever you like.

332
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,585
Eggos?

333
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:23,939
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

334
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:26,257
[sighs]

335
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,759
See, I was thinking,

336
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,096
once all this is over and Will's
back and you're not a secret anymore,

337
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:33,682
my parents can get you an
actual bed for the basement.

338
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:35,475
Or you can take my room if you want,

339
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:38,103
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

340
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,313
My point is, they'll take care of you.

341
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,107
They'll be like your new parents,

342
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:44,960
and Nancy, she'll be
like your new sister.

343
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,821
Will you be like my brother?

344
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:50,615
What? No, no. [scoffs]

345
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:52,242
Why "no"?

346
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:53,719
Because... [sighs]

347
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,829
'cause it's different.

348
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,163
Why?

349
00:24:57,164 --> 00:25:00,309
[sighs] I mean, I don't
know, I guess it's not.

350
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,686
It's stupid.

351
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:04,963
Mike?

352
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:06,214
Yeah?

353
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,442
Friends don't lie.

354
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:10,736
[sighing] Well...

355
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:13,113
I was thinking...

356
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:15,408
I don't know...

357
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:19,227
maybe we can go to
the Snow Ball together.

358
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,271
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

359
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:24,065
where you go in the gym and
dance to music and stuff.

360
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,966
I've never been, but I know you're
not supposed to go with your sister.

361
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,654
- No?
- I mean...

362
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,865
you can, but it'd be really weird.

363
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:35,636
You go to school dances with
someone that, you know...

364
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,204
someone that you like.

365
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,248
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

366
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,726
[sighs] Uh... uh...

367
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,396
Uh, someone like a...

368
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,993
[car approaching]

369
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:03,396
Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back.

370
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,832
Stay here.

371
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,881

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,432
[agent] Go!

374
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,934
You two, on me.

375
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,172
This will charge your battery
right up, I'm telling you.

376
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,716
- [Mike] Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

377
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,385
[panting] They found us.

378
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,113
[agent] We know they're here.

379
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:40,743
Be advised, west side
of the building is clear.

380
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:46,189
[agent] Sir, we've searched
everywhere. There's no sign of them.

381
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,459
[indistinct radio chatter]

382
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:51,795
[agent] Nothin'.

383
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:56,115
Keep it locked down.

384
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,426
[agent] All right.

385
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,553
Kitchen.

386
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,789

[panting]

388
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:06,876
How did they find us?

389
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:08,740
I don't know, but they
knew we were in the gym.

390
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:10,009
Lando.

391
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:13,258
- [agent] Got 'em!
- [Mike] Go, go, go, go, go!

392
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:14,509
[Lucas] Come on!

393
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,718
[agents yelling indistinctly]

394
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,662
- There they are. Freeze.
- [Mike] Back! Go back!

395
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:19,557
[Mike] Go, go! Go left!

[Eleven thuds]

[Mike panting] El, are you okay?

400
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,088
El!

401
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,752
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

402
00:27:53,753 --> 00:27:55,925
No, no, no, she won't wake up. El!

403
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,695
El! [echoing] El!

404
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,115
[Hopper] There's more blood.

405
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,748
Oh, my God.

406
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:14,461
[Joyce] This way.

407
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,252
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

408
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:13,354
[Dr. Brenner] Leave her.

409
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:19,217
- Step away from the child.
- [Mike] No!

410
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:21,010
You want her, you have to kill us first.

411
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,887
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

412
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:24,782
- Oh, no! No, no!
- No! No! Get off me!

413
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:27,201
- [screaming] You idiot!
- No!

414
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:30,412
- [Dustin] Get off me!
- [Mike] Ow! Let go!

415
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,648
Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me?

416
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:34,792
Eleven?

417
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,734
Papa?

418
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:39,279
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

419
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,743
- [Mike] Get off of me. [grunts]
- [Dr. Brenner] I'm here now.

420
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:44,325
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!

[whimpering]

422
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:48,162
Shh, shh, you're sick.

423
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,331
You're sick, but I'm
going to make you better.

424
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:54,252
I'm going to take you back
home, where I can make you well again.

425
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,254
Where we can make all of this better,

426
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,273
so no one else gets hurt.

427
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,779
Bad.

428
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:06,949
Bad.

429
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,855

He's gone. The bad man's gone.

We'll be home soon, and my mom...

she'll get you your own bed.

465
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,825
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

go to the Snow Ball.

Eleven, stop! [screams]

[monster squealing]

[squealing continues]

496
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,279
Goodbye, Mike.

497
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,085
[monster squealing]

498
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,300
No more.

[yelling]

502
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,772
El? El?

503
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:55,715
- El!
- [Lucas] Eleven!

504
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,818
- [Dustin] Eleven!
- [Mike] El!

505
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,154
El, where are you?

506
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,281
Eleven!

507
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:04,616
El?

508
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,246
[Joyce panting] Oh, God.

509
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,316
[sobbing] He's not
breathing, he's not breathing.

510
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,999
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen
to me, listen to me, listen to me.

511
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,876
- I need you to tilt his head back...
- Okay.

512
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:20,698
- and lift his chin.
- Okay.

513
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,283
One, two, three, four.

514
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:23,367
Now when I tell you,

515
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:27,246
you're gonna pinch his
nostrils, and breathe into his mouth...

516
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,248
- twice.
- Okay.

517
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,374
One second...

518
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,959
then pause.

519
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,711
22, 23.

520
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:34,837
- Then one second.
- Okay.

521
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:36,922
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

522
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,901
29, 30. Now! Go!

523
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:43,846
[Joyce whimpers]

524
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,667
- [Joyce] Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

525
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,558
Come on, kid.

526
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,768
- Come on, kid!
- Will!

527
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,060
Will, listen to me.

528
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,396
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

529
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:53,606
I love you so much.

530
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,901
I love you more than
anything in the world.

531
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:58,903
[echoing] Please...

532
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,524
- [EKG monitor beeping]
- [nurse] Blood pressure keeps dropping.

533
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,450
Her pulse ox is falling.

534
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,576
[Joyce sobbing]

535
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,245
I love you so much. I love you
more than anything in the world.

536
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:11,081
[sobbing] Please, please
come back to me. Just...

537
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,334
- Come on, kid!
- Please, please wake up.

538
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,627
Please, please.

539
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,629
[Joyce echoing] Breathe, Will, come on!

[sobbing]

542
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,710
[Joyce echoing] Come
back to me, breathe.

543
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,346
I need you to wake up now.

544
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,781
I need you to breathe.

545
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,408
Please breathe!

546
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:31,227
Please!

547
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:33,229
[Will gasps and coughs]

548
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,396
[Joyce] That's it.

549
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:37,625
- Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
- [coughing]

550
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,195
That's it, baby. Breathe.

551
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,405
Breathe. All right. Come on.

552
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,865
Come on.

553
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:47,034
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

554
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,828
Good, good, good, good.

555
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:52,015
Just breathe, Will, breathe. [sobbing]

556
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:24,965
Michael?

557
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,218
Michael!

558
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,223
Michael?

559
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:39,420
[sobs] Oh, my God.

00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:40,981
Oh, my God.

561
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:43,108
You're okay.

00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:45,819
You're okay.

[EKG monitor beeping]

564
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:24,840
Hey.

565
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:26,735
- Hi, sweetheart.
- [Jonathan] Hey.

566
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,680
Where... where am I?

567
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:32,991
[Joyce sighs]

568
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,703
[Jonathan] You're home. You're home now.

569
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:38,562
You're safe.

570
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:40,290
Jonathan.

571
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,002
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

572
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,881
[sighs] We missed you.

573
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,800
We really missed you.

574
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,344
Are you okay?

575
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:55,722
What, this?

576
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,933
It's just a cut. It's nothing.

577
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,854
You're worried about my hand.

578
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,148
[both chuckle softly]

579
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,526
[Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh...

580
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,219
We, uh...

581
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,530
We brought you some stuff...

582
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,200
so you don't get bored in here.

583
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,035
So... [sniffles]

584
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:22,082
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

585
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:25,585
There's some stuff on there I
think you really might like.

586
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:56,658
[snoring]

587
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,324
Guys. Guys, he's up. Will
is up. Guys, Will's up.

588
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:15,784
[Lucas and Dustin grunt]

589
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:17,137
[Mike] Guys, come on.

590
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:21,790
- [Mike] Byers!
- [Dustin laughs]

591
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,667
[Joyce] Be careful. Be careful with him.

592
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,335
- [Dustin] Move.
- [Jonathan] Guys, guys.

593
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,188
- [Mike laughs]
- [Jonathan] Go easy on him.

594
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,757
You won't believe what
happened when you were gone, man.

595
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,467
- It was mental.
- [Lucas] You had a funeral.

596
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,385
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

597
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:35,137
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

598
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,281
- [Lucas] Yes!
- [coughing]

599
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:42,746
You okay?

600
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:44,831
It got me.

601
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:46,982
The Demogorgon.

602
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,525
We know.

603
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:49,610
It's okay.

604
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,070
It's dead.

605
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,279
We made a new friend.

606
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,341
She stopped it. She saved us.

607
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,302
But she's gone now.

608
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:00,954
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

609
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:02,289
Well, we call her "El" for short.

610
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,457
She's basically a wizard.

611
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,708
[whispers] She has superpowers.

612
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:05,793
More like a Yoda.

613
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,419
[Dustin] She flipped
a van with her mind,

614
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,670
and these agents were
trying to shoot us...

615
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,756
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

616
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:12,883
[Dustin] And blood was pouring
out of their faces.

617
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:14,301
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.

618
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:16,365
[Lucas] Agents just
started grabbing us and stuff...

619
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:18,986
- [Dustin] ...shot out of the wall...
- [continues indistinctly]

620
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:46,184
[Mike] Something is
coming. Something angry.

621
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:47,519
Hungry for your blood.

622
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,438
It is almost here.

623
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,607
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

624
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:52,774
It's not the thessalhydra.

625
00:44:52,775 --> 00:44:54,401
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

626
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:55,944
- [loud thud]
- The thessalhydra!

627
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,613
- Damn it.
- [Mike] It roars in anger!

628
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,406
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

629
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:01,217
Fireball him!

630
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:05,388
Fireball the son of a bitch.

631
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,084
- Fourteen!
- [all exclaim]

632
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:14,004
Direct hit. Will the Wise's
fireball hits the thessalhydra.

633
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:16,089
It makes a
painful... [imitates screeching]

634
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,134
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

635
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:22,596
Its clawed hand reaches
for you one last time

636
00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:24,264
and, and, and...

637
00:45:24,265 --> 00:45:25,766
and...

638
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,494
[all cheering]

639
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,274
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

640
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:36,360
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

641
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,654
You carry the heads out
of the dungeon, victorious,

642
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,322
and you present them to King Tristan.

643
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:42,026
He thanks you for your
bravery and service.

644
00:45:42,027 --> 00:45:44,826
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, that's not it, is it?

645
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:46,203
No, there's a medal ceremony...

646
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:48,455
Oh, a medal ceremony? What
are you talking about?

647
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:50,499
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

648
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,125
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

649
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:53,349
But it doesn't make any sense.

650
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,754
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

651
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:57,297
And the proud princess?

652
00:45:57,298 --> 00:45:58,820
And those weird flowers in the cave?

653
00:45:58,821 --> 00:45:59,905

00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:02,219
Jeez, what's that smell?

656
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,971
Have you guys been playing
games all day, or just farting?

657
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:05,514
[chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin.

658
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:06,765
He farted.

659
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,201
- Dustin farted. [blows raspberry]
- [Dustin] Okay.

660
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,518

- Very mature, Lucas.

661
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:10,644

662
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:12,187

663
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:13,851

- [Lucas] Dustin farted!

664
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,954

00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:18,026
[Mike] See you, Will.

666
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:20,445

like a little girl.

669
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,055
[boys laughing]

670
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:39,715
- So, you have fun?

671
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:40,841
[Karen] Hey, boys.

673
00:46:41,926 --> 00:46:44,011
Hey, wish your mom a
Merry Christmas for me, okay?

674
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:45,929
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, Merry Christmas.

675
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,365
Merry Christmas.

676
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:50,017

00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:00,753
Thanks, um...

680
00:47:01,654 --> 00:47:03,238
I... I didn't get you anything.

681
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,240
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

682
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:09,262
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

683
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:13,474
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

684
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:23,151
Merry Christmas.

685
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:26,070
- You ready? Let's go.
- [Will] Yeah.

686
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,410
[sighs] All right. Buckle up.

687
00:47:37,648 --> 00:47:38,749
Can I open it?

688
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:41,294
Yeah, sure.

689
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:45,363
Whoa.

690
00:47:45,364 --> 00:47:46,465
Pretty cool.

[chuckles]

692
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:49,844
Yeah.

693
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:53,139
Yeah, pretty cool. [chuckles softly]

694
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:57,685
[snoring]

695
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,363
Did you give it to him?

696
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,490
Yeah.

697
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:20,499
[indistinct chatter]

698
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:43,046
You leaving already, Chief?

699
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:44,699
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted

700
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,424
to come to this
thing? I was just hungry.

701
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:47,843
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

702
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:50,929
Well, your wife doesn't have time to
cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

703
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,281
[Powell chuckling]

704
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:54,784
Merry Christmas, Hop.

[dog barking]

707
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:07,881
- [Jonathan] What you got there?
- [Christmas music playing]

708
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:09,007
That one of yours?

709
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:11,110
- Yeah.
- [Jonathan] Looks pretty big.

710
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:15,781
Be careful. You'll break it.

711
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:22,979
What are you... What are you doing?

712
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,481
[Jonathan] Documenting.

713
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:25,941
Oh, why?

714
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:27,400
- Because...
- [Joyce chuckles]

715
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:30,654
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

716
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:33,281
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

717
00:50:33,282 --> 00:50:36,701
- They're so runny.
- [chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great.

718
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:39,287
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

719
00:50:39,288 --> 00:50:40,664
The green present. It's an Atari.

720
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:43,392
I felt Dustin's today, it's
the same exact weight.

721
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:46,336
- Really? Well...
- [Will] Yeah.

722
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:51,716
We'll have to see, won't
we? Hey, no more snooping.

723
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:53,969
No, I forgot to wash my
hands. I'll be right back.

724
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,280
Okay.

725
00:50:56,097 --> 00:50:58,407
- [softly] He's washing his hands?
- [chuckles]

726
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:06,499
[coughs]

[groans]

729
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,449
- [Jonathan] Thanks.
- [both laughing]

730
00:51:43,644 --> 00:51:44,829
Are you okay?

731
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:47,748
Yeah, I'm okay.

732
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:49,542
[Jonathan] Mmm. Very good, Mom.

733
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:53,737
Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will
tell you about, uh, the game?

734
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:54,988
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

735
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:57,365
I threw a fireball at him
and... [imitates explosion] dead.

736
00:51:57,366 --> 00:51:59,743
Wait, what is... You mean, this is...

737
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:01,328
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

738
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:03,163
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.
