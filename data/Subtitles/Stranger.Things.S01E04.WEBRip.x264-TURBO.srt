- Well, I thought you knew.

163
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:05,212
Those men from State, they...
they sent Gary home last night.

164
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,674
So who did the autopsy?

165
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:10,843
Someone from State.

167
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:39,830
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

in the past.

176
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,699

You went back to my house?

To look for Barb.

196
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,971
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

to all of us now.

Okay, let me get this straight.

Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

238
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:03,617

00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,500
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

243
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,751
It is crazy!

244
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

245
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:16,422
He talked to me!
