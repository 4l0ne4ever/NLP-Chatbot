00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:06,066
[Mike sighs] That's better.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,325
You don't need it.

3
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,603
Still pretty?

4
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,480
Yeah!

5
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,458
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:30,798
El?

7
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,092
Yes?

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,347
[stammers] Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,932
Me, too.

10
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,048
- [door opens]
- Guys!

11
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,950
[panting] It's Lucas, I
think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:53,637
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:55,305
- [Mike] Yeah.
- What if he found it?

14
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,408
[Lucas shouting indistinctly on radio]

15
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,434
What's he saying?

16
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,579
I don't know, he's way out of range.

17
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:03,605
[Lucas] ...son of a bitch!

18
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,817
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow
down. We can't understand you.

19
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,486
Yes, I copy! Do you?

20
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,321
They know about Eleven!

21
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,448
Get out of there! They
know about Eleven!

22
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,034
The bad men are coming! All of them!

23
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,787
Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!

24
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,539
"Mad hen." Does that
mean anything to you?

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,957
Like a code name or something?

26
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,501
- [Lucas] The bad men are coming!
- "Bad men."

27
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,211
- Bad men!
- [radio static]

28
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,231
[gasps] Stay here.

29
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:38,807
[Mike] What's that guy doing?

30
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,827
You don't think...

31
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:45,204
Well, I know she and Steve have
been spending some time together,

32
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,456
- so I thought maybe...
- Mom!

33
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:48,191
[stammers] Well, is he home?

34
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,318
- Maybe you could ask him?
- Mom!

35
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,694
I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please?

36
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:53,038
Michael, I'm on the phone. I've
told you a million times...

37
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,906
- Did you schedule any repairs?
- What?

38
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,677
Is there anyone supposed to
come and do repairs on the house?

39
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,379
I don't understand. Is
there something wrong...

40
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,715
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- [Dustin] Mike!

41
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,759
- One second.
- [yells] Mike!

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,780
We need to leave... [panting] right now.

43
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,826
- [sighs]
- Michael!

44
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,687
If anyone asks where I
am, I've left the country.

45
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:26,873
What?

46
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,836
[Dustin grunts]

47
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,609
[Dustin] Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- [Lucas on radio] Dustin!

51
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,857
Dustin, do you copy?

52
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,776
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

53
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,486
- Where are you?
- Cornwallis.

54
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,862
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!

55
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,572
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

56
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,883
Okay.

57
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,309

- This way, come on!

Out of the way!

- Out of the way!
- [ringing continues]

61

- [Mike] Lucas!
- Where are they?

62
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:47,164
- [stammers] I don't know.
- I think we lost them.

Holy... holy shit!

00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,665
Did... did you see what
she did to that van?

71
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,833
No, Dustin, we missed it.

72
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,419
- [stammering] I mean that was...
- [Lucas] Awesome.

[Lucas panting]

74
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,190
It was awesome.

75
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,910
Everything I said about you
being a traitor and stuff...

76
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,621
I was wrong.

77
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,459
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,173
Friends...

79
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,967
friends don't lie.

80
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,180
I'm sorry, too.

Hey.

Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?

87
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,063
- [Callahan] Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

88
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:08,553
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

89
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,764
Well, your boy assaulted a
police officer. That's why.

90
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,141
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.

91

- Take them off!
- You heard her. Take 'em off.

92
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:20,875
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

93
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,865
What is this?

94
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,533
Why don't you ask your
son? We found it in his car.

00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,243
- What?
- Why are you going through my car?

96
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,587
Is that really the question you
should be asking right now?

97
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,289
I wanna see you in my office.

98
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,725
You won't believe me.

99
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,812

You think my son is hiding this girl?

111
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,299
What happened to her hair?

112
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,926
We just need to know if you've
seen her in the past week.

113
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,221
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.

114
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,015
Our son with a girl?

115
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,392
[chuckles] I mean, believe me,

116
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,812
if he had a girl sleeping in
this house, we'd know about it.

117
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,481
Wouldn't we?

118
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,565
[Karen sighs]

119
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,400
This girl...

120
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,526
what has she done?

121
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,361
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

- Oh, my God, is she Russian?
- [stammers]

123
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:34,949
- You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.

124
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,743
You come into my house,

125
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,329
and you tell me that my
son is hiding some girl,

126
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,540
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

127
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,477
And you, what, you
expect me to remain, what, calm?

128
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,404
[sighs]

129
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,158
I understand how upsetting this is.

130
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,453
I wish we could tell you more...

131
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:08,834
but I can tell you that your
son, Michael, is in real danger.

132
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,737
We want to help him.

133
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,633
We will help him. I give you my word.

134
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,595
But in order for me to do that...

135
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,015
you have to trust me.

136
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,144
Will you trust me?

137
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,092
Good.

138
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,361
Now...

139
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,740
do you have any idea where
your son might have gone?

140
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:47,063
[Lucas] This is Randolph
Road, right here.

141
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,709
The fence starts here, and
goes all the way around.

142
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,736
And this is the lab right here.

143
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,320
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

144
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,406
It's gotta be.

145
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,366
[Dustin] Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

146
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,868
The sign says "Department of Energy."

147
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,078
Department of Energy? What
do you think that means?

148
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,122
It means government. Military.

149
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,374
- [Dustin] Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

150
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,958
It's military. My dad's told me before.

151
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,752
Mike's right. There's
soldiers out front.

152
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,880
Do they make, like, lightbulbs
or something?

153
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,172
[Mike] No, weapons...

154
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,956
to fight the
Russians, and commies and stuff.

155
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,600
[Lucas] Weapons.

156
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,846
[gasps] Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

157
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,724
Really bad. The place
is like a fortress.

158
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,850
Well, what do we do?

159
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,602
[Mike] I don't know,
but we can't go home.

160
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:27,103
We're fugitives now.

161
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,480
[helicopter approaching]

162
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,833
[stutters] Guys?

163
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,668
Do you hear that?

164
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,117
- [Mike] Go, go, go, go!
- [Dustin] Come on, come on!

165
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,869
- It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

166
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,203
- [Mike] Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
- [Lucas] Come on!

167
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,705
[Dustin] Go, go, go, go, go, go!

168
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,248
[helicopter whirring]

169
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,601
- [panting]
- [Lucas] Get down!

170
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,882
[helicopter receding]

171
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,359
Mental.

172
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,281
[Joyce sighs]

173
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,267
You say blood draws this thing?

174
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,703
We don't know.

175
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,955
It's just a theory.

176
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,234
[Jonathan] I'm sorry, Mom.

177
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,321
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

178
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,198
- That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.

179
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,782
That's not even close. That's
not even in the... in the ballpark.

180
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,369
I wanted to tell you, I just...

181
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,704
What if this thing took you, too?

182
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,083
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

183
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,628
[stammers] I thought I
could save Will... I still do.

184
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,089
This is not yours to fix alone.

185
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:41,010
[stammers] You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

186
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,220
You're not alone.

187
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,680
I know.

188
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,181
[sighs] God damn it, Jonathan.

189
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,993
- I know.
- Damn it.

190
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,954
[sniffling]

191
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,063
[Troy's mom] I want an apology!

192
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,314
[Callahan] An apology for what, exactly?

193
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,149
[Troy's mom] Where is the
chief? I want to speak to him

194
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,567
- right this instant.
- Stay here.

195
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,486
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

196
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,737
What is your name, Deputy?

197
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,614
Well, I'm an officer... [chuckles] okay?

198
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,157
[Troy's mom] Name and
badge number, both of you!

199
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,261
- What the hell is going on here?
- [Powell] Chief...

200
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,161
These men are humiliating my son.

201
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,247
- No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.

202
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,791
There was some kind of fight, Chief...

203
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,459
A psychotic child broke his arm!

204
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,796
- A little girl, Chief. A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone?

205
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,131
Honestly, I'm just
trying to state a fact.

206
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,632
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl...

207
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,301
Will you please take a
statement... [mouthing] and get her out?

208
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,285
- [Callahan] Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like?

209
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:26,806
She had no hair and she
was bleeding from her nose.

210
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,808
Like a freak.

211
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,035
What'd you just say?

212
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,228
I said she's a freak!

213
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,106
No, her hair. What'd
you say about her hair?

214
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,108
Her head's shaved.

215
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,961
She doesn't even look like a girl.

216
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,380
And...

217
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,215
And what?

218
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,301
Tell the man, Troy.

219
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,972
She can...

220
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,499
do things.

221
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,877
What kind of things?

222
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,020
Like...

223
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,440
make you fly.

224
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,719
And piss yourself.

225
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,821
What?

226
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,407
Was she alone?

227
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,684
She always hangs out with those losers.

228
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,953
"Losers"?

229
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,581
What losers?

230
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,752
Hey.

231
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,381
You owe me $1.20.

232
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:27,737
Don't worry, he'll need more than
aspirin when we're done with him.

233
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:30,244
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

234
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,913
The cops should just
lock him up forever.

235
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,582
- Did you see the look on his face?
- [Steve groans]

236
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,501
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

237
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,245
He probably had that same look whenever
he killed his brother, right?

238
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:43,508
Oh, God, I just got an
image of him making that face

239
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,926
- while he and Nancy are screwing.
- [chuckles]

240
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,950
Carol, for once in your
life, shut your damn mouth!

241
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:49,762
- What?
- Hey, what's your problem, man?

242
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,059
You're both assholes. That's my problem.

243
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,477
- Are you serious right now, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

244
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,661
You shouldn't have done that.

245
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:56,938
- Done what?
- You know what.

246
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,898
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

247
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,234
Oh, that's funny, because I
don't remember you asking me to stop.

248
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,985
I should've put that spray
paint right down your throat.

249
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,695
- What the hell, Steve?
- [Steve] You know,

250
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,864
neither of you ever cared about
her. You never even liked her,

251
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,616
because she's not
miserable like you two.

252
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,160
She actually cares about other people.

253
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,452
The slut with a heart of gold.

254
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,745
I told you to watch your mouth!

255
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,123
Hey! I don't know what's
gotten into you, man,

256
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,500
- but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.

257
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,085
- Or what?
- [grunts]

258
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,253
Or what?

259
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,921
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

260
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,089
You gonna fight me now, too?

261
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,484
Because you couldn't
take Jonathan Byers...

262
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:29,321
so I wouldn't recommend that.

263
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,394
[car door opens]

264
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,479
Here, let me get
the door for you, buddy.

265
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,357
That's right. Run away, Stevie boy!

266
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,943
Run away! Just like you always do.

267
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,381
That Nancy's turning
you into a little pussy!

268
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,741
- [tires screeching]
- That's right, Harrington, run away!

269
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,470
Run away! [scoffs]

270
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,630
[Nancy] I have to go home.

271
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,233
No, you can't.

272
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,070
- My mom... my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.

273
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,598
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.

274
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,342
- Let go!
- Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

275
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:16,851
The last thing in the world we need

276
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,644
is them knowing you're
mixed up in all this.

277
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,272
- Mike is over there...
- They haven't found him.

278
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,648
Not yet, at least.

279
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,417
[helicopter whirring]

280
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,004
- For Mike?
- Come on, get in the car.

281
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,450
Look, we need to find
them before they do.

282
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,274
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone?

283
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,746
- No, I don't.
- I need you to think.

284
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,539
I don't know. We haven't talked a lot.

285
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,458
I mean, lately... [sighs]

286
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,709
Is there any place that your...

287
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,753
your parents don't
know about that he might go?

288
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,963
- [stuttering] I don't know.
- I might.

289
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,131
What?

290
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:51,236
I don't know where he is, but
I think I know how to ask him.

291
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,705
Whoa.

292
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,797
I got it.

293
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,704
[helicopter hovering]

294
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,333
[Nancy on radio]
Mike, are you there? Mike?

295
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,751
You guys hear that?

296
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,979
Mike, it's me, Nancy.

297
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,715
Mike, are you there?

298
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,467
Answer.

299
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,219
Mike, we need you to answer.

300
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,863
Is that your sister?

301
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,474
This is an emergency, Mike.

302
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,868
Do you copy?

303
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,520
Mike, do you copy?

304
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,146
Okay, this is really weird.

305
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,731
Don't answer.

306
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,900
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick?

307
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,736
- It's your sister!
- What if the bad people kidnapped her?

308
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,522
What if they're forcing her to say this?

309
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:53,698
I need you to answer.

310
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,325
It's like Lando
Calrissian. Don't answer.

311
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,178
We need to know that you're there, Mike.

312
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,706
Listen, kid, this is the
chief. If you're there, pick up.

313
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,791
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

314
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,918
Why is she with the chief?

315
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,295
How the hell does he know about...

316
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:11,299
[Hopper] We can protect you, we
can help you, but you gotta pick up.

317
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,027
Are you there? Do you copy? Over.

318
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,031
[sighs]

319
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,953
Anybody got any other ideas?

320
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,039
[Mike] Yeah, I copy.

321
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,066
It's Mike.

322
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,502
I'm here.

323
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,131
We're here.

324
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,267
[Steve] Need a hand?

325
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,520
Did you have something to do with this?

326
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,689
I just...

327
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,858
I wanna help.

328
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,576
All yours.

329
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:19,158
[sighs] They expect us to
just sit here like prisoners.

330
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,868
We should be out there looking for him.

331
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,746
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

332
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,624
This is our
government. They're on our side.

333
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,726
[Karen sighs]

334
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,646
That man gives me the creeps.

335
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,340
Nancy.

336
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,884
You don't think she's involved
in this, too, do you?

337
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,386
Nancy with Mike?

338
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,946
[chuckles] No.

339
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,033
- No.
- [sighs]

340
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,246
[Dustin breathing heavily]

341
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,861
Will you stop pacing?

342
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,905
It's been way too long.

343
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,908
Do you know what? Maybe you're
right. Maybe this is all a trap

344
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,772
and the bad men are
coming to get us right now!

345
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:03,786
It's not a trap.

346
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,871
Why would the chief set us up?

347
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,124
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

348
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,583
Lando Calrissian.

349
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,335
Would you shut up about Lando?

350
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,679
I don't feel good about
this. I don't feel good about this!

351
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,660
[shouting] When do you
feel good about anything?

352
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,401
[vehicles approaching]

353
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,310
[Dustin] Shit!

354
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,746
[Mike] Go, go, go, go.

355
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,691
[panting] Lando.

356
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,526
You think they saw us?

357
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,295
Both of you, shut up.

358
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,323
[grunts]

359
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,587
- [man 1] Hey!
- [blows landing]

360
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:24,909
[man 1 grunts]

361
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,345
[man 2] What the... [grunting]

362
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,639
[door creaks]

363
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,019
[breathing heavily] All right, let's go.

364
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,355
Let's go!

365
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,881
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

366
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,744
I was so worried about you.

367
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,264
Yeah, uh... me, too.

368
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:17,979
Is that my dress?

369
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,635
Okay, so, in this
example, we're the acrobat.

370
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,638
Will and Barbara, and that
monster, they're this flea.

371
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,099
And this is the Upside
Down, where Will is hiding.

372
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,644
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

373
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,348
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

374
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:36,742
With our compasses.

375
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,902
Okay, so the gate has a really
strong electromagnetic field,

376
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,196
and that can change the
directions of a compass needle.

377
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,489
Is this gate underground?

378
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,258
[Eleven] Yes.

379
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,345
Near a large water tank?

380
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,222
Yes.

381
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,557
[stutters] How do you know all that?

382
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,710
He's seen it.

383
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,646
[Joyce] Is there any
way that you could...

384
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,382
that you could reach Will? That
you could talk to him in this...

385
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,550
The Upside Down.

386
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,277
[whispering] Down. Yeah.

387
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,054
[Nancy] And my friend Barbara?

388
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,615
Can you find her, too?

389
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,538
[static]

390
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,879
[static increases]

391
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,812
[static becomes faint]

392
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:47,926
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,053
What?

394
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,281
[stuttering] What's
wrong? What happened?

395
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,033
[voice breaks] I can't find them.

396
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,893
[turns faucet off]

397
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,802
[Mike] Whenever she uses
her powers, she gets weak.

398
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,429
The more energy she
uses, the more tired she gets.

399
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,099
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.

400
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,476
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.

401
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,437
Well... [stutters] How
do we make her better?

402
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,357
We don't. We just have
to wait and try again.

403
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,275
[Nancy] Well, how long?

404
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,735
I don't know.

405
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,070
[Eleven] The bath.

406
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,422
[Joyce] What?

407
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,718
I can find them.

408
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,262
In the bath.

409
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,558
[screaming]

410
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,644
[woman] Oh!

411
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,047
Oh. Oh, my... No, mmm-mmm.

412
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,231
Hey, you know how they did
that? You know what that is?

413
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:10,467
[sighing] No, what?

414
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,095
Melted plastic and
microwaved bubble gum.

415
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,055
[woman] No way. Really?

416
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,699
Really.

417
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,368
[phone ringing]

418
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,145
- What in the world?
- Do you want me to pause it?

419
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,831
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

420
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,817
Hello?

421
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,694
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

422
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,655
Dustin? Is everything okay?

423
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,365
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

424
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,534
I have a science question.

425
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,996
It's ten o'clock on
Saturday. Why don't we pick this up...

426
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,040
Do you know anything about
sensory deprivation tanks?

427
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,917
Specifically how to build one?

428
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,980
Sensory deprivation? [stutters]
What is this for?

429
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,256
Fun.

430
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,025
Okay. Well...

431
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,261
Why don't we talk about it
Monday? After school, okay?

432
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,805
You always say we should
never stop being curious.

433
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,807
To always open any
curiosity door we find.

434
00:25:58,808 --> 00:25:59,933
Dustin...

435
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,662
Why are you keeping this
curiosity door locked?

436
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,189
[sighs]

437
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,482
Uh-huh.

438
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,293
[indistinct chatter over phone]

439
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,546
Uh-huh. How much?

440
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,506
Uh-huh.

441
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,576
Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful.

442
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,286
Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke.

443
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:21,870
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday. I'll
see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

444
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,040
Bye.

445
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,417
Do you still have that kiddie
pool we bobbed for apples in?

446
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,795
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah.

447
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,546
Good. Then we just
need salt. Lots of it.

448
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,357
How much is "lots"?

449
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,527
1,500 pounds.

450
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,322
Well, where are we
gonna get that much salt?

451
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,499
[Jonathan grunting]

452
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,403
Hey, wait.

453
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,447
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

454
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,616
[sighs] Worst case, no school.

455
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,410
Even if we find Will in there...

456
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,037
what are we gonna do about that thing?

457
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,413
We're not gonna do anything.

458
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,915
I don't want you anywhere
near this, all right?

459
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,526
Your mom's been through enough already.

460
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:07,417
He's my brother.

461
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,838
Listen to me. I'm gonna
find him. All right?

462
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,464
You gotta trust me on this.

463
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,275
I am going to find him.

464
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,784
[grunting] This damn thing is heavy.

465
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,732
Come on. It's upside down.

466
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,084
[Lucas] No, this way.

467
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,446
- Okay, um...
- How does this even work?

468
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,699
- Try that side.
- [grunts] Son of a bitch!

469
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,784
- Pull it back. Pull it back.
- I am!

470
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,495
- [Lucas] One, two, three.
- [grunts]

471
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,931
Shit!

472
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,548
[grunts] Ah.

473
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,733
[Nancy] Stand back.

474
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,200
Whoa.

475
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,903
[Nancy] What did she even eat?

476
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,614
- [Mike] What?
- Eleven.

477
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:22,969
[Mike] Oh. Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

478
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,305
She really likes Eggos.

479
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,583
[Nancy] I knew you were
acting weird. I just...

480
