- [Eleven] No!
- Jesus Christ.

- Robin.

- [Jonathan] Need you to stay real still.

[Mike] The Mind Flayer,
it built this monster in Hawkins,

71
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,561
to stop El, to kill her
and pave a way into our world.

72
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,483
[Nancy] And it almost did.
That was just one tiny piece of it.

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,020
[Hopper] How big is this thing?

74
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,524
[Jonathan] It's big. [murmurs]

75
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,017
- Thirty feet, at least.
- [Lucas] Yeah.

76
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,938
It sorta destroyed your cabin.

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,700
Sorry.

78
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,778
Okay, so, just to be clear, this...

79
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,453
this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El,

80
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,544
it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?

81
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,040
- Yes.
- But instead of, like, screws and metal,

82
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,963
the Mind Flayer made its weapon...

83
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,540
with melted people.

84
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,416
- Yes, exactly.
- [Steve] Yeah, okay.

85
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,883
I... Yeah, I'm just making sure.

86
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,053
Are we sure this thing is still out there,
still alive?

87
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,933
El beat the shit out of it,
but, yeah, it's still alive.

88
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,614
- But if we close the gate again...
- We cut the brain off from the body.

89
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,638
And kill it.

90
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,098
Theoretically.

91
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,022

Okay, this is what Alexei called
"the hub."

95
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,108
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.

96
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,703
Okay, where's the gate?

97
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,948
Right here.
I don't know the scale on this,

98
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,241
but I think it's fairly close
to the vault room,

99
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,035
maybe 50 feet or so.

100
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,328
More like 500.

101
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,205
What, you're just gonna waltz in there
like it's commie Disneyland or something?

102
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm sorry, who are you?

103
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,503
Erica Sinclair. Who are you?

104
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,877

106
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,881
Listen, Mr. Bunman,

107
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,844
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do things,

108
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,934
but I've been down in that shithole
for 24 hours.

109
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,101
And with all due respect,
you do what this man tells you,

110
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,311
you're all gonna die.

111
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old
speaking to me?

112
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,564
Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!

113
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,316
- Erica!
- Just the facts!

114
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,938
She's right. You're all gonna die,
but you don't have to. Excuse me.

115
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,567
- Sorry, may I?
- Please.

116
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,119
Okay, see this room here?
This is a storage facility.

117
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,251
There's a hatch in here that feeds
into their underground ventilation system.

118
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,418
That will lead you to the base
of the weapon.

119
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,919
It's a bit of a maze down there,

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,590
but between me and Erica,
we can show you the way.

121
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,209
You can show us the way?

122
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,983
Don't worry, you can do all the fighting
and the dangerous hero shit,

123
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,007
and we'll just be your...

128
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,438
[Erica] Well, that settles it.

129
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,817
He's gonna die. They're gonna die.

130
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,953
Yep, most likely.

131
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,071
You guys survived.

132
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,699
Barely.

133
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,712
We could've really used you guys
down there.

134
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,868
Could've used you up here, too.

135
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,208
Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.

136
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,634
Yeah. Big-time.

137
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,342
I missed you guys, too.

138
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,754
Big-time.

139
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,594
Please don't cry, nerds.

140
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,514
- Erica.
- Keep saying my name, see what happens.

141
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,223
Hey, heads up. You can navigate,
just from someplace safe.

142
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,158
- It's not that simple.
- The signal won't reach.

143
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,786
Not with this. You need something
with a high enough frequency band

144
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,371
to relay with the Russians' radio tower.

145
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,124
But for that to work, you need someone
who has both seen their comms room

146
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,898
and has access to a super-powered
handcrafted radio tower,

147
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,244
one preferably already situated
at the highest point in Hawkins.

148
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Oh, wait.

149
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,655
That's me.

150
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,466
If you want us to navigate, you got us.

151
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,741
But we need a head start.

152
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,794
And a car.

00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,848
[Mike] Scoops Troop, do you copy?

328
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,024
Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy?

329
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,274
We're trapped in the mall
and in need of emergency transportation.

330
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,070
[Mike] Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Billy has found us.

331
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,863
He has disabled our car
and we are trapped in the mall.

332
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,697
Repeat: Billy has disabled our car
and we are trapped in the mall.

333
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,904
- Scoops Troop...
- You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

334
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,872
This is just a precaution, okay?

335
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,535
And not just against Billy.

336
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,924
If he knows we're here,
so does the Mind Flayer.

337
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,501
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need
of emergency transportation.

338
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,258
- Do you copy?
- [radio static hissing]

339
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,970
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

340
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,262
No chance that thing'll drive, right?

341
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,584
- [Mike] Steve, do you copy?
- We don't need it to drive.

342
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,011
[Mike] Dustin!

343
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,931
We just need the ignition cable.

344
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,977
[all straining]

345
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,478
[Jonathan] Push!

346
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,607
[metal squealing]

347
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,323
[straining continues]

348
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,283
- [glass shatters]
- [Will] Shit!

349
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,833
Let me try.

350
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,289
[panting] El...

351
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,288
[sighs]

352
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,870
I can do it.

353
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,375
[Mike sighs]

354

[brakes squealing]

364
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,835
[in Russian] Can I help?

365
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,591
[in Russian] Picking up.

366
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,545
Do I know you?

367
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,511
New arrivals.

368
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,130
Landed last night.

369
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,013
Say goodbye to sunlight.

370
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,597
Who needs sunlight

371
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,482
when we have one another, comrade?

372
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,386
[chuckles] Indeed, comrade!

373
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,477
And a bottle of Stolichnaya.

374
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,773
[both laughing]

375
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,701

[Murray chuckles]

00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,368
[loud beeping]

379
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,210
Why are you talking so much?

380
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,297
He was nice.

381
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,089
- He was nice?
- He was a nice guard.

382
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,987
Yeah, I mean, we should probably
invite him over after all this is done.

383
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,488
[Joyce] Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.

384
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,990
[Hopper] Get a six-pack,
share some laughs.

385
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,104
- You know, have a drink.
- [Murray seethes]

386
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,194
Ugh.

387
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,571
Anyone wanna trade jobs?

388
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,705
[Dustin on radio] Bald Eagle, do you copy?

389
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,573
Bald Eagle, I repeat,
this is Scoops Troop, do you copy?

390
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,737
Yes, I copy.

391
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,823
[all chuckle with relief]

392
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,738
Call sign?

393
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,825
[scoffs]

394
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,500
Bald Eagle.

395
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,788
Please repeat.

396
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,081
- Bald Eagle. This is Bald Eagle!
- [Dustin] Copy that.

397
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,286
Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle.
What's your 20?

398
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,922
We reached the vent.
I'll contact you when I need you.

399
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,295
Until then, silence.

400
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,382
Roger that, Bald Eagle.

401
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,347
This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent.
10-10, over.

402
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,854
I hate children.

403
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,057
[Murray groans]

404
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,612
- Remember, if anyone says anything, just...
- Smile and nod.

405
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,437
[sighs] Good luck.

[grunting, panting]

410
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,664
[Jonathan] All right, great.

411
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,340
All right, now, all the way. Ready?

412
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,552
Three, two, one... Push!

413
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,934
[all straining]

414
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,805
Told you.

415
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Physics.

416
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:09,902
How do we get it open?

417
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,032
Uh, there should be a latch.
Check under the wheel.

418
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,850
- [Jonathan] You see it?
- [Nancy] I don't know, hold on.

419
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,866
What's she doing?

420
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,455

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,060
Are you okay?

[ominous music playing]

[Jonathan grunts]

427
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,591
- [Nancy] Do you see it?
- I don't know.

428
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,987
It should be right here.

429
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,616
Distributor, distributor...

[gasps]

437
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,354
Got it.

438
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,110
Nancy!

439

[creature snarling]

440
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,069

[dramatic synth music playing]

446
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,807
[in Russian] We just found them like this.

447
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,151
[in Russian] The American.

448
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,690
It's taking too long.

449
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,573
- It's fine.
- No, it's not. It is not.

450
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,821
She could've died back there.

451
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,032
She almost did.

452
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,242
Well, she's safe now.
She's on her way to Murray's.

453
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,782
That thing won't find her,

454
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,405
not before we kill it.

455
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,952
Hey. This isn't the way
this is supposed to work, all right?

456
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,036
You're supposed to say,
"Yes, I told you so.

457
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,883
That's why we needed to go back
to the kids."

458
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,352
Oh, yeah, and then
you say something like...

459
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,187
[as Hopper]
"Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen

460
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,381
when you make everything sound
like it's the end of the goddamn world."

[gentle Russian ballad playing]

462
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,259
You know...

463
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,385
I think, despite everything,
I mean, despite the arguing,

464
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,113
I think we make a pretty good team.

465
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,355
[clicks tongue]

466
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,321
Well, we made it this far, didn't we?

467
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,200
[Joyce sighs]

468
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,279
Yeah.

469
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,281
We did.

470
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,489
We did.

471
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,245
So, uh...

472
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,669
did I get the job or what?

473
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,587
Ah, come on.

474
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,010
Detective Byers.

475
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,178
It has a ring, doesn't it?

476
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,863
It's kinda hard to serve in a town
where you don't live, Detective.

477
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,353
[clicks tongue]

478
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,999
You're still moving outta here.
I mean, that is the plan, right?

479
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,113
[sighs] Eh, we'll see how it goes.

480
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,442
"How it goes"? How what goes?

481
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,034
You know, if... if we actually do
make it out of here,

482
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,784
we... we deserve to celebrate, right?

483
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,867
Yeah.

484
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,453
I mean...

485
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,287
yes.

486
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,748
Absolutely.

487
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,171
I hear Enzo's is pretty good.

488
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,182
What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock?

489
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,638
Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice
on Fridays.

490
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,358
It... It starts at 10:00,
so I... I can't be out late on a Friday.

491

[male reporter]
Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana,

1004
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,810
a wonderful place to grow up,

1005
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,032
to raise your family,

1006
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,648
to walk your dog.

1007
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,145
- But then...
- [sirens wailing]

1008
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,776
...on July Fourth,
everything changed.

1009
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,452
A terrible tragedy struck
this small town.

1010
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,618
But this was not this small town's
first brush with tragedy.

1011
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,917
Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups,

1012
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,250
a bizarre chemical leak.

1013
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,462
Is it all linked?

1014
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,006
All a vast conspiracy?

1015
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,091
The fault of a disgraced,
corrupt mayor?

1016
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,258
Or is something more going on
in the heartland?

1017
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,886
- Can a town itself be cursed?
- [woman screams]

1018
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,143
Some believe a rise in Satanism
is to blame.

1019
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,186
- [eerie cackling laughter]
- To find out,

1020
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,729
tune in tonight at 8:00 p.m.
for "Horror in the Heartland"

[indistinct chatter]

1023
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,912
You put your mom down as a reference?

1024
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,740
Yeah. Why not?
She's, like, super well-respected.

1025
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,541
[Robin] You're such a dingus.

1026

[Steve] Wha...

1027
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,851
[Robin] Uh, just to be clear,
we weren't fired, you know.

1028
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,045
The mall burned down and, like,
killed a bunch of people.

1029
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,009
Thanks for sharing.
Didn't know.

1030
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,724

Uh... The Apartment,

00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,432
Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise.

1033
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,555
You, go.

1034
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,685
- Favorite movies?
- Did I stutter?

1035
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,188
- Uh... Animal House, for sure.
- [Robin scoffs]

Um...

1037

Eyes on me, Harrington.

1038
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,231
Yeah. Uh...

1039
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,402
Star Wars.

1040
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,485
A New Hope?

1041
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,451
A new what-now?

1042
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,490
Which Star Wars?

1043
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,034
The one with the teddy bears. Duh.
[squeals like an Ewok]

1044
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,408
No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out.
The movie that just came out.

1045
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,786
The one with the DeLorean
and Alex P. Keaton,

1046
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,794
and he's trying to bang his mom.
[chuckles]

1047
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,134
The time...

1048
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,646
Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.

1049
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,964
You start Monday.

1050
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,513
You start never.

1051
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,434
Will you just, um...
Will you give us a minute?

1052
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,466
Why?

1053
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,557

- [yanks resume aggressively]

1055
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,401
All right, you have to understand, Keith,

1056
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,650
I know his taste is a bit pedestrian,

1057
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,244
but the dingus has other qualities.

1058
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,620
He's a douchebag of the highest order,
Robin.

1059
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,578
He was a bit of a prick to us
in high school, I'll grant you that,

1060
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,829
but he remains...

1061
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,658
a total chick magnet.

1062
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,366
Yeah, okay,
and this is relevant to me how?

1063
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,627
Uh, Earth to Keith.

1064
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,132
The ladies will come in just to see him.

1065
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,552
They'll come in in droves.

1066
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,173
Droves, Keith.

1067
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,966
We sold so much ice cream,

1068
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,180
they had to get a second shipment in
from Michigan.

1069
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,430
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.

1070
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,103
And these ladies... [inhales sharply]

1071
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,971
These ladies are hot.

1072
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,980
They're so very hot.

1073
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,651
And there are too many of them
for little Steve.

1074
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,324
He needs assistance.

1075
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,239
He needs your assistance, Keith.

1076
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,067
What's in it for you?
You got a thing for him or something?

1077
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,367
[Steve] Goddammit. This is...

I left some Eggos out in the woods,
