Well...

Theoretically-speaking,

823
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:51,527
I suppose some large version of
this AC transformer could exist.

But, in order to reach your
house and downtown, gosh,

827
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,294
that would take billions
of volts of electricity

828

- Exactly.

Well, I guess we translate the rest
and hopefully a pattern emerges.

A pattern. Right, like maybe
"silver cat" is a meeting place?
