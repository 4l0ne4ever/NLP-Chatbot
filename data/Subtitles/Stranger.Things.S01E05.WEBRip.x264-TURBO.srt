00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:17,679
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,555
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

13
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:22,517
Look, Dr. Brenner asked for
me specifically. Okay?

14
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:23,981
How else do you think I got in here?

[Hopper scoffs]

What's your name again?

17
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,439
It's Jim Hopper.

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,233
Chief Jim Hopper.

19
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,211
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper... [grunts]

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,255
- [man on radio] Come again?
- [grunts]

[indistinct radio chatter]

23
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:41,494
Hey...

24
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:43,097
you mind if I borrow this one?

25
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,516

- [liquid pouring]
- [Lonnie] Drink.

28
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:57,861
It'll calm your nerves.

29
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,198
Help you think straight, yeah?

30
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:07,830
I don't know what to do.

31
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,666
I know. I know.

32
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:14,336
[sniffs] This whole time...

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,657
I... I could... I could feel him.

34
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,051
He was...

35
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:24,120
He was so close. He
was... he was right there.

36
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,956
- I knew he was alive.
- [thunder rumbles]

37
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:31,836
Our hands... our
hands were almost touching.

38
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:34,940
Now it's like I... uh...

39
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:39,236
[sobbing] God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

40
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,348
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

41
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,475
Like how everybody is looking at me.

42
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:47,495
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

43
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:51,439
You're not gonna like this,

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,169
but I think you need to seriously
consider the possibility that all this...

45
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,529
It's in your head.

46
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,923
[scoffs]

47
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,034
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

48
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:06,079
No, this is not that.

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,703
I mean, when something
like this happens,

50
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,849
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

51
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,051
I mean, Jesus, there's a
funeral tomorrow for our little boy

52
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,071
and you're saying his body is fake.

53
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:18,567
He's in the wall.

54
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:21,236
I mean, how do you explain that?

55
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,640
- [stammers]
- It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

56
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:29,435
- At least go talk to a shrink or...
- [sighs]

57
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:32,563
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...
- I don't... Well, they can't help.

58
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:34,541
Joyce, you just told me...

59
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,877
that Will is gone.

60
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,923
- What else is there to do?
- [sniffles]

61
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:46,470
Hey.

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,603
[sniffles]

63
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:02,235
[Hopper] Will?

64
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:04,697
Will?

65
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,366
Will?

66
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,537
Will?

67
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:34,333
[Mike] What was Will saying?

68
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,645
Like home... Like home...

69
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,523
but dark?

70
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:41,859
[Lucas] And empty.

71
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,388
[sighs] Empty and
cold. Wait, did he say cold?

72
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,558
I don't know. The stupid radio
kept going in and out.

73
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,102
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark.

74
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:54,020
Like home. Like his house?

75
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:55,354
Or maybe like Hawkins.

76
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,981
Upside down.

77
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:59,317
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

78
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:00,961
- [Lucas] What?
- Upside down.

79
00:05:01,862 --> 00:05:05,823
When El showed us where Will was, she
flipped the board over, remember?

80
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,867
Upside down.

81
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,577
Dark. Empty.

82
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:11,996
Do you understand what
he's talking about?

83
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,998
- No.
- [Mike] Guys, come on, think about it.

84
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:17,126
When El took us to find Will, she
took us to his house, right?

85
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:19,003
Yeah. And he wasn't there.

86
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,797
But what if he was there?

87
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,840
What if we just couldn't see him?

88
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,902
What if he was on the other side?

89
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:29,156
What if this is Hawkins and...

90
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:31,807
this is where Will is?

91
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,518
The Upside Down.

92
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,329
Like the Vale of Shadows.

93
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,707
[Hopper] Will?

94
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,294
- Will?
- [alarm blaring faintly]

95
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:46,673
Will?

96
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:50,052
[alarm continues]

I see him! Hey! Stop!

100
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,306
[Dustin] "The Vale of Shadows

101
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:16,661
is a dimension that is a dark
reflection or echo of our world.

102
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,695
It is a place of decay and death."

103
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:27,113
[Hopper] Will?

104
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:31,093
"A plane out of
phase. A place of monsters.

105

It is right next to you, and
you don't even see it."

- [Hopper coughing] Will?

107

Will?

108
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:43,647
An alternate dimension.

109
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,549
But... how... how do we get there?

110
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,675
You cast Shadow Walk.

111
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,051
In real life, dummy.

112
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:51,154
We can't shadow walk, but...

113
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:53,532
maybe she can.

114
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,994
Do you know how we get
there? To the Upside Down?

115
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:02,749
[sighing] Oh, my God!

What's going on?

128
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,629
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here
tonight. [stammers] On the couch.

129
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,757
[Lonnie] Yeah, I'm here as
long as you need me, okay?

130
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,651
How are you holding up?

131
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,388
What happened?

132
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,116
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

133
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:44,810
that thing you saw
before, did it come back?

Jonathan, that's enough.

Can we talk?

Alone?

138
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,404
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

139
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:57,073
We all are.

140
00:09:57,074 --> 00:10:01,243
But you need to listen to me. Your
mother is sick. Really sick.

141
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,828
Yeah. Well, you being here,

142
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:04,121
you're just making
things worse, like always.

143
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:05,247
- Worse?
- Yeah!

144
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,291
She took down that wall with an ax.

145
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,635
She said that Will was
inside and that he's talking to her.

146
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:11,045
Yeah. Maybe he was.

147
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,880
This isn't some kind of joke.

148
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,965
Your mom was half frozen
to death when I got here.

149
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,425
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

150
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:18,761
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

or whatever the hell
you want to call it,

152

you're gonna push her
right over the edge.

You hear me?

154

I'm here to help.

better around here for all of us.

[scoffs] Thank God you're here.

Do me a favor. At the
funeral tomorrow, just behave.

If not for me, for your mother.

160
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:51,019
Take that down. It's inappropriate.

161
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:01,887
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

162
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:04,699
Ah... there. It's supposed
to be a little tight.

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,851
Looks good.

165
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:12,415
You look nice, sweetie.

166
00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:16,735
Anything else?

167
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:18,696
You can borrow my
black heels if you want.

168
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:20,614
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

169
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:23,009
I'm fine. Thanks.

170
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:32,560
[whimpering]

171
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:50,704
Ugh.

172
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,286
Come on. Time to go.

173
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:08,888
[groans softly]

174
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,018
- Come on.
- [sighs]

175
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,963
[Pastor Charles] "Fear
not, for I am with you.

176
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:20,734
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

177
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:23,677
I will strengthen you.

178
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:25,930
Yes, I will help you.

179
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:29,701
I will uphold you with
my righteous right hand."

180
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:34,164
It's times like these that
our faith is challenged.

181
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:37,792
How, if He is truly benevolent...

182
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:42,130
could God take from us someone
so young, so innocent?

183
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:46,051
It would be easy to
turn away from God...

184
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,370
but we must remember that nothing,

185
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:52,081
not even tragedy, can
separate us from His love.

186
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:55,167
We are here today to find
comfort in the truth of scripture,

187
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:57,503
- and to surround Will and his family...
- [sniffles]

188
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,396
Just wait till we
tell Will that Jennifer

189
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,923
Hayes was crying at his funeral.

190
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:02,317
[shushes]

191
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:14,144
- [Karen] I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

192
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:16,313
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

193
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:18,458
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

194
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:21,711
Take care, all right? Thanks.

195
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,297
Thanks for coming out.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,352
I see Will the Wise is back.

197
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:41,964
What's that shooting out of his cane?

198
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,465
Fireballs.

199
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:45,843
I couldn't find the red
crayon, so that's why it's green.

200
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:46,969
Oh, well...

201
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,097
if he's so wise, why
does he need fireballs?

202
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:53,409
Why can't he just, you
know, outsmart the bad guys?

203
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:56,103
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

204
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:59,481
But... sometimes the
bad guys are smart, too.

205
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,583
You know?

206
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,109
Yeah.

207
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,153
So he needs the fireballs?

208
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:07,031
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

209
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:09,533
All right. Well, I don't
know who's been raising you,

210
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,036
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

211
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:15,039
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

212
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,391
[both chuckle]

213
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,563
[gasping]

214
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:28,027
[breathing heavily]

215
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,168
[panting]

216
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,569
[dishes clattering]

217
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,701
[exclaims]

218
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,778
[Lucas] Will! Will,
it's us! Are you there?

219
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,278
[Dustin] Can you hear us? We're here!

220
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,655
[Will distorted] Hello? Mom?

221
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:14,550
- [Lucas] Why can't he hear us?
- [Mike] I don't know!

222
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,970
[Will distorted] Mom, it's coming!

223
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,247
She was there.

224
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:22,040
[church bell tolling]

225
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,877
This is where we know for
sure it's been, right?

226
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:27,421
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

227
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:30,048
And that's the woods where
they found Will's bike and...

228
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,216
that's my house.

229
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:34,178
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

230
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,638
I mean, it's all within
a mile or something.

231
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,034
Whatever this thing is,
it's... it's not traveling far.

232
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,037
You want to go out there.

233
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,897
We might not find anything.

234
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,332
I found something.

235
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:52,213
And if we do see it...

236
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:56,301
then what?

237
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:57,468
[sighs]

238
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,139
We kill it.

239
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,435
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

240
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:16,595
Are you serious?

241
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:21,075
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

242
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,312
This is a terrible idea.

243
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:27,940
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

244
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:30,943
What? You can tell someone, but
they're not gonna believe you.

245
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,027
You know that.

246
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:33,362
Your mom would.

247
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:35,948
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

248
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:37,407
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

249
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:38,885
when this thing is dead.

250
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,499
I don't know what in
the world caused it.

251
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,751
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

252
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:50,504
Mr. Clarke says he's never
seen anything like it.

253
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:51,648
Mr. Clarke?

254
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,633
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

255
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:55,842
[repairman] That right?

256
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:59,321
Apparently, some of the less athletic
types go nuts for this stuff.

257
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,621
[engine starting]

258
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,674
[indistinct chatter]

259
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,924
[Mike] Mr. Clarke?

260
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:37,652
Oh, hey, there.

261
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:39,845
How are you boys holding up?

262
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,555
[munching]

263
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:44,057
We're... in... mourning.

264
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:46,893
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

265
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:49,271
[Mike] We were
wondering if you had time to talk?

266
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:52,524
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

267
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:55,527
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan
talks about other dimensions?

268
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:56,737
Like, beyond our world?

269
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,322
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

270
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,489
Right, theoretically.

271
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,159
So, theoretically, how
do we travel there?

272
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,503
You guys have been thinking about

273
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,764
Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds
Interpretation, haven't you?

274
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,334
Well, basically, there
are parallel universes.

275
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:11,835
Just like our world,

276
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:14,397
but just infinite variations of it.

277
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:16,819
Which means there's a world out there

278
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,643
where none of this tragic
stuff ever happened.

279
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,552
Yeah, that's not what
we're talking about.

280
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:22,179
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

281
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,043
of an evil dimension, like
the Vale of Shadows.

282
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:25,432
You know the Vale of Shadows?

283
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,016
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic...

284
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,019
[Mike] Yeah, exactly.

285
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,480
If that did exist, a place
like the Vale of Shadows,

286
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,898
how would we travel there?

287
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,876
- Theoretically.
- [Mr. Clarke] Well...

288
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,425
Picture... an acrobat...

289
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:44,868
standing on a tightrope.

290
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,579
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

291
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,123
And our dimension has rules.

292
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:53,060
You can move forwards, or backwards.

293
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:55,128
But, what if...

294
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:59,341
right next to our
acrobat, there is a flea?

295
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:02,552
Now, the flea can also travel back
and forth, just like the acrobat.

296
00:20:02,553 --> 00:20:03,929
- Right?
- Right.

297
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,306
Here's where things get
really interesting.

298
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:08,684
The flea can also travel this way...

299
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,894
along the side of the rope.

300
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,622
He can even go...

301
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:14,773
underneath the rope.

302
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:17,067
- [boys] Upside down.
- Exactly.

303
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:19,403
But we're not the
flea, we're the acrobat.

304
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:21,738
In this metaphor,
yes, we're the acrobat.

305
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,407
So we can't go upside down?

306
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:24,825
No.

307
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:27,661
Well, is there any way for the
acrobat to get to the Upside Down?

308
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:31,331
Well... you'd have to
create a massive amount of energy.

309
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:34,209
More than humans are
currently capable of creating, mind you,

310
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,586
to open up some kind of
tear in time and space,

311
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:37,897
and then...

312
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:45,137
you create a doorway.

313
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,889
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

314
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,767
- But again, this is all...
- Theoretical.

315
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,311
But... but what if this
gate already existed?

316
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,814
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

317
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:57,190
It would disrupt gravity,

318
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,234
the magnetic field, our environment.

319
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:01,754
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

320
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:04,531
Science is neat.

321
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:07,385
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

322
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:20,022
Whoa.

323
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:24,610
Hey, Chief!

324
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:27,321
- [knocking] Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

325
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,600
- [Powell] Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

326
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:35,371
- We tried calling, but...
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

327
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:39,858
Hey, so Bev Mooney came
in this morning all upset.

328
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,611
Said that Dale and
Henry went hunting yesterday...

329
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:43,875
and they didn't come back home.

330
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:48,439
She thought they were on another
binger, but she's not so sure now.

331
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,621
I think this whole Will Byers
thing has everybody on edge.

332
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:54,331
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

333
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:56,333
No, no. Where did
Henry and Dale go hunting?

334
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:58,311
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

335
00:21:58,711 --> 00:21:59,878
Mirkwood.

336
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,230
What?

337
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,048
Okay.

338
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,860
You go back to the station. I'll
take care of this, all right?

339
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,595
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

340
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:12,140
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

341
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:15,143
Barbara Holland's car. Seems
she ran away after all.

342
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:17,771
Staties found it late last
night at a bus station.

343
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:20,916
Funny, right? They keep
doing our job for us.

344
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:24,795
Yeah. [chuckles] It's funny.

345
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:27,965
[door closes]

346
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:31,910
- Is he off his meds again?
- [engine starts]

347
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:34,621
He's been spending too
much time with Joyce Byers.

348
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:35,973
That's what I think.

349
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:45,090
[sighs] What are you doing?

350
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:46,800
What does it look like I'm doing?

351
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,461
You want to freeze to death all winter?

352
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:50,446
[hammering continues]

353
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:55,642
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

354
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:58,120
How long are you gonna
keep those up? I mean, really?

355
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:05,443
You know, it's a shame what
they've done to this family.

356
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:07,320
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

357
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,114
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

358
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:11,199
I just wanted to look around, you know?

359
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,803
Couldn't believe it. I
just couldn't believe it.

360
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,474
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

361
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,602
Ought to be held
accountable if you ask me.

362
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:28,466
It would take a lot of
energy to build a gate like this.

363
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:29,890
But that's got to be what happened.

364
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:33,763
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

365
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:36,742
What we want to know is, do
you know where the gate is?

366
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:40,579
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

367
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,613
[Mike] Dustin, what
are you doing? Dustin?

368
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:50,965
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

369
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,950
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

370
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:56,345
Your compasses. All of
your compasses, right now!

371
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:03,418
What's exciting about this?

372
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,005
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

373
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:08,989
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

374
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,135
I mean exactly what I just
said. That's not true north.

375
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:14,572
Are you both seriously this dense?

376
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:20,769
The sun rises in the east, and
it sets in the west. Right?

377
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,229
Which means that's true north.

378
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,213
So what you're saying is
the compasses are broken.

379
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,568
[sighs] Do you even
understand how a compass works?

380
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,904
- Do you see a battery pack on this?
- No.

381
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,989
No, you don't. Because
it doesn't need one.

382
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,867
The needle's naturally drawn to
the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

383
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,369
So what's wrong with them?

384
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,454
Well, that's what I couldn't
figure out, but then I remembered.

385
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:41,737
You can change the
direction of a compass with a magnet.

386
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:44,198
If there's the presence of a
more powerful magnetic field,

387
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,835
the needle deflects to that power.

388
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:47,587
And then I
remembered what Mr. Clarke said.

389
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,339
The gate would have so much power...

390
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,043
It could disrupt the
electromagnetic field.

391
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,133
Exactly.

392
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:54,594
Meaning, if we
follow the compasses' north...

393
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:56,655
They should lead us to the gate.

394
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,853
[sighs]

395
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,193
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

396
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:55,547
- [exhales] What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

397
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:59,200
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

398
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:00,660
What? No.

399
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:02,805
Oh, no, I was just...

400
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:06,642
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

401
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:08,585
Well, uh...

402
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,003
listen, I'm really sorry.

403
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:12,857
I mean, even before you threatened
me with the baseball bat.

404
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:15,675
Okay.

405
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:17,260
I panicked and...

406
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:18,428
[sighs]

407
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,140
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

408
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:23,659
[sighs]

409
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:27,854
Did you get in trouble
with your parents?

410
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,189
Totally, but...

411
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,441
you know, who cares? Screw 'em.

412
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:33,377
Any news about Barbara?

413
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:37,423
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

414
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:41,576
Hey, listen.

415
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:44,662
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

416
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:47,415
Just kinda pretend
everything's normal for a few hours.

417
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,309
All The Right Moves is still playing.

418
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:52,796
You know, with your lover boy
from Risky Business? [chuckles]

419
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:53,922
Yeah, I know.

420
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:56,066
You know, Carol thinks I
actually kinda look like him.

421
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,509

- [Lonnie] No!

00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,612
The money! Admit it!

439
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:03,258
You aren't here 'cause of Will. You
never cared about him. You never did!

440
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:06,619
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral
today. Do we have to do this right now?

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,247

- I'm here to help, Joyce.

- To help?
- We could use that money for good.

[stammering] Oh, like
maybe to pay off your debts?

444
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:16,754
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

445
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,965
- Oh, don't do that.
- Do what?

Where does Jonathan want
to go to college?

So then he goes to NYU!

Get out.

All your Christmas lights.

What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

465
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:03,801
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm
crazy. Maybe I'm out of my mind!

466
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:08,890
But, God help me, I will keep these
lights up until the day I die

if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

one since I was ten.

He made me kill a rabbit.

480
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,273
- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

481
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:02,086
I guess he thought it would make
me into more of a man or something.

482
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:04,487
I cried for a week.

483
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:05,738
Jesus.

484
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:08,074
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

485
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:11,452
[chuckles] I meant your dad.

486
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:12,763
Yeah.

487
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:16,791
I guess he and my mother loved
each other at some point, but...

488
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,459
[gun cocks]

489
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,229
I wasn't around for that part.

490
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:23,774
Um, yeah.

491
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:27,319
Just, uh, point and shoot.

492
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:32,265
I don't think my
parents ever loved each other.

493
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,309
They must've married for some reason.

494
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,786
My mom was young.

495
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,229
My dad was older,

496
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,419
but he had a cushy job,
money, came from a good family.

497
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:48,781
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

498
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:50,843
and started their nuclear family.

499
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:53,745
Screw that.

500
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:55,013
Yeah.

501
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,641
Screw that.

502
00:31:00,044 --> 00:31:02,605
- [beer can clatters]
- [both chuckle]

503
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:04,857
[dialing]

504
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:07,693
[line ringing]

505
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:12,156
- [woman] Hello?
- Hey.

506
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:14,724
Jim?

507
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,559
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

508
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,312
Why are you calling me
here? I told you not to call me.

509
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:22,023
I know, I know, I
know. I just wanted to...

510
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:24,501
I just wanted to hear
your voice and, uh...

511
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,714
I just wanted to say that, um...

512
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:35,596
even after everything
that happened, I don't...

513
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,331
I don't regret any of it.

514
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:41,310
And those seven years, they
were... everything to me.

515
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:43,854
Have you been drinking?

516
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:46,648
No.

517
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,884
- No.
- [baby crying over phone]

518
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:52,095
[woman shushing] Honey, hey...

519
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:55,264
Hey, it's okay... it's okay. [shushing]

520
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:56,599
[crying continues]

521
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,976
You know what, actually, I
have been drinking, I'm sorry.

522
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:00,436
Jim, I can't...

523
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,605
Just take care of yourself, okay?

524
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:04,065
Say hi to Bill for me.

525
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,459
Are you sure...

526
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,223
[phone ringing]

527
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:24,603
[ringing stops]

528
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,321
[sighs] How much further?

529
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:38,492
I don't know. These only
tell direction, not distance.

530
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:41,769
You really need to learn
more about compasses.

531
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,312
I'm just saying.

532
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:45,815
How do we know when we get to the gate?

533
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:49,586
Uh, I think a portal to another
dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.

534
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:51,797
[sighs]

535
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,093
Do you think she's acting weird?

536
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:59,763
You're asking if the
weirdo is acting weird?

537
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:02,975
I mean, weirder than normal?

538
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,686
I don't know. Who cares?

539
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,691
[breathing heavily]

540
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,970
How far, Papa?

541
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:18,323
Farther than we've ever gone before.

542
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,705
- The bath?
- Yes.

543
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:27,332
Yes, the bath.

544
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:32,129
Is that okay?

545
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:37,426
Okay.

546
00:35:06,498 --> 00:35:07,641
Mike.

547
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,084
Yeah?

548
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:11,711
Turn back.

549
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:13,337
What? Why?

550
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:14,505
I'm tired.

551
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:18,401
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

552
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:27,661
[sighs]

553
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,213
[Nancy] You never
said what I was saying.

554
00:35:39,364 --> 00:35:40,656
[Jonathan] What?

555
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:41,866
[Nancy] Yesterday.

556
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:45,494
You said I was saying something and
that's why you took my picture.

557
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:46,763
Oh, uh...

558
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:48,932
I don't know.

559
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,602
My guess...

560
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:58,799
I saw this girl, you
know, trying to be someone else.

561
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,344
But for that moment...

562
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:03,888
it was like you were
alone, or you thought you were.

563
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:06,366
And, you know, you
could just be yourself.

564
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:12,146
That is such bullshit.

565
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:13,623
[stammers] What?

566
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:17,318
I am not trying to be someone else.

567
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:19,904
Just because I'm dating
Steve and you don't like him...

568
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:22,615
You know what? Forget it. I just
thought it was a good picture.

569
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:24,700
He's actually a good guy.

570
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:25,886
[stammers] Okay.

571
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:29,264
Yesterday, with the camera...

572
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:32,375
He's not like that at all.

573
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:34,752
He was just being protective.

574
00:36:34,753 --> 00:36:36,688
Yeah, that's one word for it.

575
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,590
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

576
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:41,175
No, I... I never said that.

577
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,618
He had every right to be pissed...

578
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,745
Okay, all right. Does that
mean I have to like him?

579
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:46,097
No.

580
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:48,265
Listen, don't take it
so personally, okay?

581
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:51,244
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

582
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:56,315
You know, I was actually
starting to think that you were okay.

583
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,234
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

584
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:01,404
Yeah, I was thinking, "Jonathan Byers,

585
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:04,699
maybe he's not the pretentious
creep everyone says he is."

586
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,784
Well, I was just
starting to think you were okay.

587
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,744
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

588
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:11,747
she's not just another suburban
girl who thinks she's rebelling

589
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:14,750
by doing exactly what every
other suburban girl does...

590
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:17,461
until that phase passes and they
marry some boring one-time jock

591
00:37:17,462 --> 00:37:18,713
who now works sales,

592
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:21,737
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

593
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:25,052
Exactly like their parents, who
they thought were so depressing,

594
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:27,155
but now, hey, they get it."

595
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:28,740
[scoffs]

596
00:37:33,603 --> 00:37:34,704
[scoffs]

597
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:36,581
[pounding on door]

598
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,358
Go away, Lonnie.

599
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,627
[continues pounding]

600
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:43,380
Seriously!

601
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:46,299
I am gonna murd...

602
00:37:48,577 --> 00:37:51,180
[whispers] What? What?

603
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,313
[Hopper sighs]

604
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:03,358
Oh, Jesus.

605
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:05,986
[scoffs]

606
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:18,856
Oh, no.

607
00:38:18,857 --> 00:38:21,734
"Oh, no"? What's, "Oh, no"?

608
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,277
- We're headed back home.
- What?

609
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:24,612
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

610
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:27,031
Setting sun, right there. We
looped right back around.

611
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:29,658
And you're just realizing this now?

612
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,661
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

613
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:34,246
What do yours say?

614
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:35,873
[both] North.

615
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:38,417
- [Lucas sighs]
- Makes no damn sense.

616
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:40,461
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.

617
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:42,421
No, I don't think it's the gate.

618
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:45,341
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

619
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:47,176
Maybe it's something here.

620
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:49,678
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

621
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,430
It's not a magnet.

622
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,432
She's been acting weirder than normal.

623
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:56,416
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

624
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,478
Why would she do that?

625
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,522
Because she's trying to
sabotage our mission.

626
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:00,957
Because she's a traitor!

627
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:05,003
[Mike] Lucas, what are you doing?

628
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:08,906
You did it, didn't you?

629
00:39:08,907 --> 00:39:10,783
You don't want us to reach the gate.

630
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:12,701
You don't want us to find Will.

631
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:14,105
[Mike] Lucas, come on, seriously,

632
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:15,489
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

633
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,023
- No.
- Admit it!

634
00:39:17,874 --> 00:39:21,043
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

635
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:24,213
I saw her wiping her nose on the
tracks! She was using her powers!

636
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:26,107
Bull! That's old blood. Right, El?

637
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:29,277
Right, El?

638
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,949
[crying] It's... not...

639
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,577
it's not safe.

640
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:46,669

641
00:39:57,414 --> 00:39:59,123
[panting] Okay.

642
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:00,809
Should be okay, I mean...

643
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,878
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

644
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,629
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

645
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,923
They bugged my place.

646
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:09,341
- What?
- They bugged my place.

647
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:11,903
They put a microphone in the light.

648
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:14,513
[sighs]

649
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:17,224
It's because I'm on to
them and they know it.

650
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,018
- I don't know...
- Who?

651
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,682
I thought they might
be watching you, too.

652
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:23,814
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

653
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:26,066
You gotta explain this
to me, 'cause I am not...

654
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:29,212
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

655
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,673
What?

656
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:33,675
It wasn't him.

657
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:35,576
What?

658
00:40:35,577 --> 00:40:37,804
Will's body, it was a fake.

659
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:42,392
[Joyce exclaims]

660
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,479
You were right.

661
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:51,151
This whole time, you were right.

662
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:59,266
What did I tell you? She's been
playing us from the beginning!

663
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:01,560
That's not true. She
helped us find Will!

664
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:02,645
Find Will?

665
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:03,979
Find Will?

666
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,441
Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.

667
00:41:07,442 --> 00:41:10,194
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

668
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:11,528
Just think about it, Mike.

669
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:14,281
She could've just told us
where the Upside Down was right away,

670
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:15,449
but she didn't.

671
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,493
She just made us run around
like headless chickens.

672
00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:19,203
- All right, calm down!
- No!

673
00:41:19,204 --> 00:41:21,080
She used us, all of us!

674
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:23,540
She helped just enough so
she could get what she wants.

675
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:24,833
Food and a bed.

676
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:27,127
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

677
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:29,213
No! Screw you, Mike. You're blind...

678
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:31,590
blind because you like that a
girl's not grossed out by you.

679
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:34,152
But wake up, man! Wake the hell up!

680
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,261
She knows where Will is,

681
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:39,139
and now she's just letting
him die in the Upside Down.

682
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,684
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

683
00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:42,810
Shut up.

684
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:45,354
We're looking for some stupid monster...

685
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:49,667
but did you ever stop to
think that maybe she's the monster?

686
00:41:50,694 --> 00:41:52,069
I said shut up!

[grunting]

688
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:55,572
- Stop!
- [Dustin] Knock it off, you idiots.

689
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:56,991
- Stop it!
- [Dustin] Mike, get off!

Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right?

694
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,214
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

695
00:42:12,215 --> 00:42:14,383
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- [Dustin] Come on, Lucas!

696
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:16,152
Why would you do that?

697
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:18,957
- [Dustin] Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

698
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:21,908
[distorted] What is wrong with you?

many fingers am I holding up?

- Get off of me!
