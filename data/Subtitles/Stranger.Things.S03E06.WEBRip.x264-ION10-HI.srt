what are they powering?

188
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,721
And tell him that we know
it is not the Starcourt Mall,

189
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,853
so he can stop selling us that crap.

[in Russian] Those generators you were
working on, what are you powering?

191
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,267
We know it's not the mall.

192
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,989
[in Russian] This tastes like
shit strawberry.

193
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,938

"It's strawberry."

So what?

199
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,168
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...

200
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,878
Well, they didn't have cherry.

201
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,666
They didn't have it.

202
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,839
And it doesn't matter,

203
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,840
because it all tastes the same, okay?

204
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,552
It is sugar on ice. You tell him that.

205

Tell him what?

206

You tell him that it all tastes
the goddamn same!

207

[Murray, in Russian] It's all the same.

208

Sugar on ice. No difference.

209

it is not the same in the slightest,

210
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,396
and I would like the cherry I requested.

211

[in English] He respectfully disagrees.

212
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,663
[Murray] It's not the same at all,

213
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,488

Why do you think that is?

he's scared.

I'm just being realistic.

317
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,936
I mean, we've made it about
point-three miles in nine hours.

318
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,197
Then we had to walk three hours
down that tunnel,

319
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,989
so I'd estimate ten miles back
to the elevator,

320
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,075
which should take us approximately
twelve-and-a-half days.

- Can't put the truth back in the box.

00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,297

- Let's examine the facts, shall we?

00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,137
Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.

That was
a pretty straightforward equation.

00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,386
Fact number two:
you're a political junkie.

331
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,977
Just because I don't agree
with Communism as an ideology...

332
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,943
Fact number three:
you love My Little Pony.

333
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,574
And what does My Little Pony
have to do with this?

334
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,572
Ah, let's recall the ponies'
latest adventure, shall we?

335
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,195
The evil centaur team and Tirek

336
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,621
turns Applejack into a dragon
at Midnight Castle,

337
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,221
and then Megan and the other ponies
have to use Moochick's magic

338
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,605
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,

339
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,543
saving them from a lifetime
of enslavement.

340
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,213
All the pink in the world can't disguise
the irrefutable fact

341
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,092
that centaurs and castles
and dragons and magic

342
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,800
are all standard nerd tropes.

343
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,170
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.

344
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,718
Ergo, you, Erica,

345
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,642
are a nerd.

346
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,890
And how do you know so much
about My Little Pony?

347
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,772
Because I'm...

348
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,266
a nerd.

349
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,814
[electricity crackles]

350
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,904
[powering down noise]

351
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,731
Let's go...

352
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,857
nerd.

353
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,192
You...

354
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,199
[Steve groans]

355
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,332
That one stung.

356
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,490
[gasps for air]

357
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,998
Who do you work for?

358
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,329
For the millionth time,
I work at Scoops Ahoy!

359
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,166
Scoops Ahoy.

360
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,877
[groans]

361
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,210
[Steve] What the hell?!

362
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,048
Look at my outfit!

363
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,510
Look at my outfit!

364
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,720
You think I just wear this?!
Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform?

365
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,470
[groans]

366
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,393
[grunts]

367
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,811
How did you get in?

368
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,469
[gasps] I already told you.

369
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,886
I told you before. [gasps for air]

370
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,306
My delivery didn't come,

371
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,155
and my friends and I, we thought that
it was left at the loading dock,

372
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,609
so we went in the room,
and then it turned into an elevator,

373
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,202
and then... and then we dropped and then,

374
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,638
next thing we know,
I open my eyes,

375
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,526
and we're in this...

376
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,489
wonderful facility.

377
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,121
But I swear to God,

378
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,293
nobody knows about us,
nobody saw us.

379
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,831
You could just let us go, all right?

380
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,285
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this,
okay?

381
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,915
Shit happens, life goes on.

382
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,922
And, uh... ice... ice cream.

383
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,379
Ice cream, okay?

384
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,151
You guys know what ice cream is.
Everybody loves ice cream.

385
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,095
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream
or if that's considered gelato.

386
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,136
I don't know what's what,
but whatever you guys want, seriously.

387
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,313
USS Butterscotch,
I mean, you gotta try it.

388
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,641
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya!

389

[soldiers laughing]

[laughs nervously]

391
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,153
I like this guy!

392
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,826
"USS... Butterscotch." [laughs]

393
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,618
[soldiers continue laughing]

394

[laughter stops]

396
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,249
Who do you work for?

397
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,417
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously...

398

[grunting]

401
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,521
Get your hands off me!

402
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,772
[yelps, grunts]

403
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,605
Hey...

404
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Steve?

405
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,613
- [door buzzer sounds]
- Steve? Steve?

406
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,985
Steve?

407
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,072
What did you do to him? What did you do?

408

[Robin] Don't touch me!

Steve... [grunts]

00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,577
Steve, wake up. Steve?

00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,415
What did you do?!

417
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,594
[Robin grunts]

418
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,632
Don't touch him.

[clicking tongue]

420
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,308
Steve? Steve, can you hear me?

421
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,352
[officer, in English] I think your friend
need a doctor.

422
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,186
Good thing...

423
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,069
we have the very best.

[soldiers laugh]

You are going to regret that,

[static hissing]

435
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,638
[Mike] It can't be good for her
to be in there for this long.

436
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,002
Mike, you need to relax.

437
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,557
What if she gets brain damage
or something?

438
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,791
- Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?
- No, it's not. He made it up.

439
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,229
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.

440
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,883
- Oh, and you do?
- No, I...

441
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,633
Yes, from The Hawkins Post.

442
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,795
I... I called a couple
days ago about the...

443
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,933
- [indistinct male voice on phone]
- Yes, yes, um...

444
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:48,311
I was just... following up
to see if anything else had gone missing,

445
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,102
or if... Okay.

446
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,853
Um, sorry to bother...

447
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,515
[dial tone sounding]

448
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,113
[Max and Mike
argue indistinctly in background]

449
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,376
- [Nancy sighs] Who's next?
- [Jonathan] There is no next.

450
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,690
Unless you want to start calling
random people's homes.

451
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,172
- It doesn't make sense.
- What part of any of this makes sense?

452
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,406
There's a pattern, okay?
A consistency to their behavior.

453
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,811
They've been feeding on these chemicals
since this started,

454
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,722
and... and, what, they just stop,
out of the blue?

455
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,866
Maybe they have all the chemicals
they need.

456
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,036
Maybe they've all turned into those...
things.

457
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,625
But what about the source?

458
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,380
I mean, did the Mind Flayer
just suddenly stop infecting people?

459
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,554
And even if the flayed are monsters now,
why can't El find them?

460
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,644
Okay, can you guys settle an argument
for us?

461
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,642
Who do you think should decide
El's limits?

462
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,063
Mike or Eleven?

463
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,141
The way that you frame that
is such bullshit.

464
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,806
It's not bullshit, Mike.
This is your whole problem.

465
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,266
And it's also precisely the reason why
she dumped your ass.

466
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,357
El dumped you?

467
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,571
Yeah, because she is conspiring
against me.

468
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,531
She's corrupting her.

469
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,781
No, enlightening her.

470
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,412
[Max] The fact is, she's not yours.

471
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,009
She's her own person,
fully capable of making her own decisions.

472
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,865
She's risking her life for no reason.

473
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,791
For no reason?

474
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,249
Mike, the flayed are out there
doing God knows what.

475
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,080
- Killing, flaying...
- Transforming into monsters.

476
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,496
And El's not stupid.

477
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,714
[Nancy] She knows her abilities
better than any of us.

478
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,165
- Exactly, thank you.
- And she is her own person.

479
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,649
- Exactly.
- With her own free will.

480
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,803
[Max] Exactly.

481
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,843
El has saved the world twice,
and Mike still doesn't trust her.

482
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,178
You wanna talk about trust, really?
After you made Eleven spy on us?

483
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,561
- Wait, what?
- Oh, she didn't tell you this?

484
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,982
- No.
- Your girlfriend used El's powers

485
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,441
- to spy on us.
- No, no, no, I did not make her.

486
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,652
It was her idea.

487
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,691
And why are we even talking about this,
seriously?

488
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,895
Yeah, who cares?

489
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,824
- I care.
- Yeah.

490
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,822
- I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.
- We were just joking around.

491
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,785
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was
taking a massive shit or something?

492
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,035
- You weren't.
- But what if I was?

493
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,699
- Then gross!
- Seriously, Mike?

494
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,627
I'm just trying to demonstrate
how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

495
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,017
In fact, how careless all of you are.

496
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,603
You're treating her like some kind
of machine when she's not a machine,

497
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,397
and I don't want her to die
looking for the flayed

498
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,315
when they've obviously vanished
off the face of the Earth.

499
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,025
So can we please just come up
with a new plan

500
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,969
because I love her
and I can't lose her again.

[door opening]

502
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,765
What's going on?

503
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,483
Nothing. Nothing.

504
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,863
Just a family discussion.

505
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,314
Oh.

506
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,650
I found him.

507
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,406
Found who?

508
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,907
[Murray] He calls it the key,
and this key emits a great energy.

509
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,498
[Alexei speaking Russian]

510
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,667
[Murray] It requires much strength, power.

511
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,338
[Alexei speaking Russian]

512
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,422
[Murray] Those houses,
like the one you found,

513
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,144
they're located near, uh, transformers.

514
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,097
They're stealing
from your town's power grid.

515
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,480
Why build this key here? Why are they not
doing this in their own backyard?

516
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,558
What are they trying to do,
blow us to smithereens?

[speaking Russian]

521
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,988
There were many of these, uh, keys before
in Russia,

522
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,162
but they turned out wrong.

523
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,241
[Alexei speaking Russian]

524
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,406
They had to come to where the...
where the, uh...

525
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,825
Where the what?

526
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,433
- I don't understand what he's saying.
- I thought you were fluent.

527
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,497
Oh, I'm sorry.

528
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,383
Are my free translation services
not good enough for you?

529
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,421
Because you can just go ahead
and file your complaint

530
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,086
right up my ass!

531
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,092
What is Smirnoff doing?

532
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,007
- He's showing me.
- [speaking Russian]

533
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,224
[Murray] Oh, okay.

534
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,476
Uh, he says the straw,

535
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,940
they're using it to penetrate a hole

536
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,362
in... a box?

537
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,403
[speaking Russian]

538
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,744
Okay, sorry, sorry.

539
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,832
[Murray] The straw represents the key,
which emits a great energy.

540
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,619
[speaking Russian]

541
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,495
They're using this energy...

542
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,706
to break through a barrier,

543
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,002
to open...

544
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,419
a doorway.

545
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,424
A doorway between worlds.

546
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,305
[Alexei speaking Russian]

547
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,095
[Murray] But it seems this key
was only half the equation.

548
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,016
[speaking Russian]

549
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,364

[speaking Russian]

553
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,993
In Hawkins,
this door had been opened once.

[speaking Russian]

555
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,370
It was still...

00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,706
healing.

557

Jesus Christ.

558
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,548
So, this door is open now?

- Can I help you with something?
- Whiskey.

00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,956
- You have whiskey?
- No, but I do have vodka.

[Hopper sighs]

00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,453
- [Hopper inhales sharply]
- Oh!

576
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,530
If there's a way to start this key,
there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?

577
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,874
Turn it off?

How hard can it be? Max did it.

- [Dustin] Aw, come on.
- You seriously thought

615
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,726
- they'd just leave keys in there?
- There's gotta be a spare.

How big did you say that Demogorgon was?

Big. Nine feet or so. Why?

A deadly weapon.

625
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,202
Could be useful.

626
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,410
- For what?
- What do you think?

627

Taking down Commies, saving your friends.

Thought you were more realistic than that,
nerd.

629
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,738
We don't even know where they are,

630
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,956
and even if we did,
there are a million guards up there

631
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,836
with weapons way deadlier than that.

632
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,675
The best thing we can do for them
is to get out of here and find help.

633
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,762
Easy with that.

634
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,555
Our chance of surviving, and theirs,
rises substantially.

I'm doing pretty good.

to your right? No, your other right.

654
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,897
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.

655
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,323
- And do you see those scissors?
- Uh-huh.

656
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,322
Yeah, well, I think that if we move
at the same time, we could get over there,

657
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,010
and then maybe I could kick the table
and knock them into your lap.

658
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,512
- And I could cut the binds.
- Yeah, and we could get out of here.

659
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,536
- Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that.
- Yeah.

660
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,262
Those morons. They left scissors in here?

661
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,210
- Yeah, morons. [laughs]
- Total morons.

662
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,042
- Okay.
- Okay, so,

663
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,957
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.

664
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,336
- Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha.
- All right.

665
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,933
One, two, three.

666
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,104
- Okay, that worked.
- Okay.

667
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,740
- All right. Uh, let's try again.
- Right.

668
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,434
[both] One, two, three.

669
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,094
- Holy shit, this is gonna work!
- We're close. Ready?

670
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,313
Okay, one, two, three.

671
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,555
[both grunting]

672
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,647
[both groaning]

673
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,976
[laughing lightly]

674
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,106
It's okay, it's okay.

675
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,815
Don't cry. Robin.

676
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,204
[Robin giggles]

677
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,949
Are you laughing?

678
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,044
[continues laughing]

679
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,577
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

680
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,246
I'm sorry!

681
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,091
I'm so sorry. It's just...

682
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,924
I can't believe...

683
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,255
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base

684
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,840
with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

685
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,762
- It's just too trippy, man.
- We're not gonna die.

686
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,304
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

687
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,638
Just... You gotta let me
just think for a second.

688
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,483
Do you remember, um,
Mrs. Click's sophomore history class?

689
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,859
What?

690
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,780
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity.

691
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,529
That's what us band dweebs called her.

692
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,487
- [sighs]
- It was first period,

693
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,657
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
so you were always late.

694
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,749
And you always had the same breakfast.

695
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,458
Bacon, egg, and cheese
on a sesame bagel.

696
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,799
I sat behind you

697
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,723
two days a week for a year.

698
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,682
Mister Funny.

699
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,591
Mister Cool.

700
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,681
The King of Hawkins High himself.

701
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,177
Do you even remember me
from that class?

702
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
[Robin chuckles]

703
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,355
Of course you don't.

704
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,991
You were a real asshole, you know that?

705
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,488
Yeah, I know.

706
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,452
But it didn't even matter.

707
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,240
It didn't matter that you were an ass.

708
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,783
I was still...

709
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,834
obsessed with you.

710
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,003
Even though all of us losers
pretend to be above it all,

711
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,460
we still just wanna be popular...

712
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,293
accepted,

713
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,627
normal.

714
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,422
If it makes you feel any better,
having those things isn't all that great.

715
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,013
Seriously.

716
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,012
[sighs] It just baffles me.

717
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,434
Everything that people tell you
is important,

718
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,683
everything that people say
you should care about, it's all just...

719
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,767
[chuckles]

720
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,154
...bullshit.

721
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,693
But I guess you gotta mess up
to figure things out, right?

722
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,895
I hope so.

723
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,319
I feel like my whole life has been...

724
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,859
one big error.

725
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,067
[chuckles]

726
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,196
Yep. [laughs]

727
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,794
At least it can't get any more messed up
than this.

728
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,250
[both chuckle]

729
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,330
You know, I wish I'd known you
in Click's class.

730
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,285
- Yeah?
- Really, I do.

731
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,375
[Robin chuckles]

732
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,463
Maybe you could've helped me
pass the class.

733
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,384
Maybe instead of being here,
I'd be on my way to college right now.

734
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,006
And I would have no idea

735
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,474
that there were evil Russians
beneath our feet,

736
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:02,604
and I would be happily slinging ice cream
with some other schmuck.

737
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,563
[both chuckle]

738
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,601
Gotta say, though,

739
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,359
I liked being your schmuck.

740
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,984
It was fun while it lasted.

741
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,193
It was.

742
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,318
- [buzzer sounds]
- [door opens]

743
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,570
[suspenseful music playing]

744
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,658
[chuckles]

745
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,744
Where were you two going?

746
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,751
[clicking tongue]

747
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,336
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

748
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:38,593
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov
less painful.

749
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,894
[winces]

750
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,723
[chuckles]

751
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,769
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

752
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,936
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
What is that thing?

753
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,574
It will help you talk.

754
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,360
Did you even clean that thing?!

755
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,324
[screams]

756
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,315
[static hissing]

757
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
[gasping breaths]

758
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,014
[Eleven breathes rapidly]

759
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,224
[gasping, panting]

760
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,849
What's he doing now?

761
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,783
[Nancy] And that's not normal, right?

762
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,200
Billy staying in his room
on the Fourth of July?

763
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,609
No, that's not normal.

764
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,657
He wants us to find him.

765
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,161
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

766
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,792
If we go to Billy, then the rest
of the flayed know where we are.

767
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,001
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

768
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,211
We won't be surprised.

769
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,295
We'll know that they're coming,
and we will kick their flayed butts.

770
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,128
You mean El will kick their butts.

771
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,604
[Eleven's voice echoes] Papa!

772
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,682
No.

773
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,148
[Terry] Rainbow.
Three to the right, four to the left.

774
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,359
Sunflower. Rainbow.

775
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,609
- [Mike] It's too risky.
- [Nancy] Yeah, and unnecessary.

776
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,863
Killing the flayed
won't stop the Mind Flayer.

777
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,816
We have to find out where
it's spreading from.

778
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,866
We have to find the source.

779
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,030
[Eleven] Billy knows it.

780
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,577
Billy's been there.

781
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
To the source.

782
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,463
- Yeah, but...
- It's a trap. I know.

783
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,001
[Eleven] We can't go to Billy,

784
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,090
but I think there's another way.

785
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,263
A way for me to see where he's been.

786
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,178
[static hissing]

787
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,555
El, I know you think you have to do this,
but you don't.

788
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,725
It's just,
you've only done this before once.

789
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,355
And your mom, she loved you,

790
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,609
and wanted you to know what happened.

791
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,235
And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased.

792
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,281
The Mind Flayer is in him.

793
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,992
He can't hurt me.

794
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,576
Not in there.

795
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,712
We don't know that.

796
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,833
Mike.

797
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,746
I need you to trust me.

798
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,509
Yeah.

799
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,102
Just... be careful.

800
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,028
[shivering breaths]

801
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,932
[Eleven exhales sharply]

802
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,624
[echoing] Billy.

803
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,834
Can you hear me?

804
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,713
I want to see.

805
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,212
I want to see what happened.

806
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,433
[suspenseful synth music playing]

807
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:52,972
[whimpering]

808
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,057
Something's wrong.

809
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,480
[screams] Stop! No! No! No!

810
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,685
No!

811
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,646
[distorted roaring]

812
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,994

[Mike, echoing] El, are you okay?

819
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,363
Are you okay?

820
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,110
[sighs]

821
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,856
[softly] I'm okay.

822
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,447
What's going on?

823
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,991
I'm... on a beach.

824
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,701
[Lucas] Okay, I may be dense,

825
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,543
but the last I checked,

826
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,287
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.

827
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,250
What else do you see?

828
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,253

[seagulls squawking]

830
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,803
[Eleven] A woman.

831
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,595
She's...

832
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,930
pretty.

833
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,850
I...

834
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,685
I think she's looking at me.

835
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,400
[echoing laughter]

836
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,519
[woman] Woo!

837
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,938
Yeah!

838
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,026
[woman laughs]

839
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,122
[woman] You did it!

840
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,783
There's...

841
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,494
a boy.

842
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,996
Did you see that?

843
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,249
Yeah, I saw that!

844
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,043
That was at least seven feet.

845
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,728
[woman] I don't know what it was,
but it almost gave me a heart attack.

846
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,882
Ten more minutes?

847
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,761
- Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.
- Okay.

848
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,260
But any longer than that,
Dad's gonna be mad, okay?

849
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,223
[boy] Okay!

850
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,352
[boy panting]

851
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,556
Billy?

852
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,430
Watch out for rip currents!

853
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,934
I know.

854
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,727
It's Billy.

855
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,150
It's California.

856
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,855
It's a memory.

857
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,155

[distant rumbling]

859
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,658
I think I see it.

860
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,294
The source.

861
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,461

00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,271
[Murray] Two minutes, Jim.

866
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,083
It's a secure line, but any longer
than that and they could trace you.

867
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,267
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.

868
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,502
- What?
- [Hopper clears throat]

Philadelphia Public Library.

871
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,409
Uh...

872
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,873
This is Jim Hopper...

873
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,214
uh... police chief, Hawkins.

874
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,750
[Hopper] I got this number
from Dr. Sam Owens.

875
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,667
What is your identification code?

876
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,962
Identification code?

877
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:10,915
You don't know it?

878
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,165
You must be joking.

879
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,716
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.

880
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,179
[chuckles] I got it.

881
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,639
You wrote it down and kept it
in your wallet?

882
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,975
"Antique Chariot." Listen.

883
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,688
[Hopper] Um, tell Owens that the Russkies
are opening the gate.

884
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,831
Now, he'll know what that means.

885
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,605
Not about the Russkies,
but about the gate.

886
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,740
Tell him that there's an entrance
at Starcourt Mall.

887
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,188
I know how to get in,

888
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,818
but I need backup, a lot of backup.

889
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,664
Have him call me back here
at 618-625-8313.

890
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,242
Your message will be relayed.

891
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,825
- So, now what?
- Now, we, uh...

892
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,875
we wait.

893
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,167
You compromised me, Jim.

894
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,922
You do realize that, don't you?
I'm gonna have to relocate.

895
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,045
- How long do we wait?
- As long as it takes.

896
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,382
How can you just sit there being calm?

897
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,968
I am not calm!

898
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,723
Our kids are in danger!

899
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,814
You said they were at the festival!

900
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,810
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!

901
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,061
[scoffs]

902
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,689
What are you doing? Joyce?

903
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,193
What are you doing?

904
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,364
[phone rings]

906
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,859
Yes, hello.

907
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,815
Uh, this is,
uh, Antique Chariot's partner...

908
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,576
Wheelbarrow.

909
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,699
I don't think Antique Chariot

910
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,036
properly conveyed the urgency
of our situation.

911
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,372
What are you doing?

912
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,457
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.

913
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,752
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.
- No.

914
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,336
Don't you dare patronize me!

915
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,222
I don't know who you are,

916
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,969
if you're some glorified secretary
or what,

917
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,102
but if you don't wanna lose your job,
here's what's gonna happen.

918
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,390
When I hang up,

919
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,103
you're gonna get up off your ass,

920
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,813
and you're gonna go find Owens
and tell him what's going on.

921
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,114
We don't have time to talk about it
and neither does he.

922
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:56,399
He's gotta get to Hawkins,
and he's gotta bring his men right now!

923
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,985
Do you understand me?

924
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,240
Yes, yes, ma'am.

925
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,491
Thank you. And good day.

926
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,294
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.

927
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,909
That's one minute too long.

928
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,248
- Alexei.
- [gasps]

929
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,500
[in Russian] What's going on?

930
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,040
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.

931
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,667
Back to Hawkins. Come on.

932
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,169
[Joyce] Come on.

933
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,688
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.

934
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,355
Do you?

935
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,565
I mean, I... I feel fine.

936
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,148
- I feel normal.
- Yeah, I feel... I feel fine.

937
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,663
I kinda feel good.

938
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,530
[both chuckling]

939
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,906
- Wanna know a secret?
- What?

940
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,254
I like it, too!

941
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,368
[both laugh]

942
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,576
- I feel good.
- Morons. They messed up the drug.

943
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,087
They messed it up!

944
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,053
- Morons. Hey, morons!
- Morons!

945
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,721
- Moron! Mor...
- Hey!

946
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,049
Whoa-oh!

947
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,968
Oh, no. There's definitely
something wrong with us.

948
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,893
- Something's wrong.
- [door buzzer sounds]

[Robin chuckles]

950
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,992
Would now be a good time to tell you
that I don't like doctors?

951
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,962
Let's try this again, yes?

952
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,748
[murmurs]

953
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,251
Who do you work for?

954
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,461
Scoops. [chuckles]

955
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,424
Scoops Ahoy.

956
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,464
[giggles]

957
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,303
How did you find us?

958
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,842
Totally by accident. [chuckles]

959
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,298
[Steve chuckles]

960
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,385
[in Russian] More lies.

961
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,059
- What is that shiny little toy?
- [Robin] Where you going with that, doc?

962
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,024
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Wait! No! Wait! Wait!

963
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,605
- Whoa!
- There was a code! We heard a code!

964
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,234
Code.

965
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,277
What code?

966
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,530
"The week is long.

967
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,993
The silver cat feeds
when blue meets yellow in the west."

968
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,204
Blah, blah, blah.

969
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:13,413
You broadcast that stupid spy shit
all over town,

970
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,897
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,

971
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,417
and we cracked it in a day.

972
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,000
A day!

973
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,506
You think you're so smart,

974
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,508
but a couple of kids
who scoop ice cream for a living

975
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,892
cracked your code in a day,
and now, people know you're here.

976
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,011
Who knows we are here, little bitch?

977
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,218
Uh, well, Dustin knows.

978
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,427
Hey, Steve?

979
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,687
- Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
- Steve!

980
